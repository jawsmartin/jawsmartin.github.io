###Hello

I am a Designer, Illustrator, and Front-End Developer from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania living in Chicago, Illinois. I currently work as an independent product designer for local startups, focusing on web/app UI/UX and branding.

In my free time, I work on variety of side projects that reflect a number of personal interests such as tattoos, basketball, and movies.

You can find updates on what I'm up to, personally and professionally, on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/jawsmartin), [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/jawsmartin) and [Dribbble](http://www.dribbble.com/jawsmartin).

My entire portfolio can be found on [Behance](http://www.behance.net/jawsmartin).

If you are interested in seeing a more detailed look into my background, such as past jobs, and program/design proficiencies, please see my [CV](../joshmartinresume.pdf) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jawsmartin).

###Contact

While I'm not currently looking for new full-time work, I'm always open to interesting opportunities to work with great people. If you think you have something we can work on together, such as consulations, speaking engagements, or offsite, short-term contract work, don't hesitate to [shoot me an email](mailto:hellojoshmartin@gmail.com).

Please note that I receive many, many emails, so it may take me a while to get back to you. Expect a response within 1-2 weeks. Also, *please do not contact me via Linkedin or Facebook as I rarely use the platforms.*

Aren't necessarily looking to work together, but want to connect? I extend the offer of coffee, scones, and some amazing small (or big) talk in *downtown Chicago*. An [email](mailto:hellojoshmartin@gmail.com) is always appropriate, but a simple [tweet](http://www.twitter.com/jawsmartin) works really well.
