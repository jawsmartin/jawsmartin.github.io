  <h3>At a Glance</h3>

  <p>Iâ€™m a Designer, Illustrator, and Front-End Developer from Pittsburgh, currently working independently in Chicago. I focus on UI/UX and creative direction.</p>

  <p>Previously at <a href="https://twitter.com/suntimes">Chicago Sun-Times</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Power2Switch">Power2Switch</a>.</p>

  <h3>My Work</h3>

  <p>It is my job to create clear, efficient, and most importantly, objective, solutions to user-interface and user-experience problems on websites and apps. It's also my responsibility to make sure said solutions are cohesive with branding, as well as within development capabilities and any imposed limitations or constraints.</p>

  <p>I have a background in animation and traditional graphic design which greatly influences the style of my work.</p>

  <p>Please see my <a href="/joshmartincv.pdf">CV</a> for detailed look at experience and proficiencies.</p>
