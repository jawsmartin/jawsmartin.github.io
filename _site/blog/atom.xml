			<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know, for a fact, I’m addicted to Dribbble&lt;/em&gt; — I check it before every project for inspiration and several times a day just to see what what is trending. For all intents and purposes, I do not need any other reminder of what is happening there. However, my friend and co-worker, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andjosh.com&quot;&gt;Josh Beckman&lt;/a&gt;, does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent that ungrateful bastard one of my Dribbble invites over a year ago an he has only posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/shots/1426532-Soundcloud-Logo-Animation?list=searches&amp;amp;offset=0&quot;&gt;one shot&lt;/a&gt;. His excuse(s)? “I just don’t have time to get on there… I forget it exists… It’s awful to look at on my small phone…” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To thrust Mr. Beckman back into the game, we came up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alleyooop.info&quot;&gt;Alleyooop&lt;/a&gt;: a customizable newletter of Dribbble shots. You can adjust frequency of the newsletter and the type of shots you want to follow. Currently, we only show the most popular shots (views + likes) from either Animated or nonanimated shots, but hope to allow even more filtration, such as location and by tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the newsletter can be quite handy for not only Beckman, but other people too good or too busy (or too smart) to visit Dribbble regularly. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alleyooop.info&quot;&gt;Give it a try!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Big Step Forward</title>

			<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have officially been coding for 2yrs, which in itself, is batshit crazy&lt;/em&gt;. I moved to Chicago after graduating college with a BFA in Applied Media Arts, which is just a fancy catch-all title for a crazy blend of animation, traditional art, art history, and graphic design. I left with the toolset need to be an intern at a tiny print shop in cold, deserted land of Northwestern Pennsylvania. In hopes that the bigger city would present opportunities for bigger jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I contacted the suave, charismatic, design juggernaut, Josh Fabian, a fellow Pennsylvanian who had recently made the move out west to Chicago.. Not even a week in did my friend, Josh Fabian, say: “Yeah. Nobody is hiring print designers, man. We need to get you learning how to make websites&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>The Best Way to Find After-School Activities for Your Kids</title>

			<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the summer of 2014, I was approached by my former [Aggrego] co-worker, [Sal Abassi]&lt;/em&gt;, to help get a personal project off the ground; that project would be Afterskoolz. As a parent, he felt there was an opportunity to create a platform to make finding and planning after-school activiites for his children easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sal, alongside fellow parent and Afterskoolz co-founder, [Mustafa Patni], laid out a rough draft of all the features they wanted Afterskoolz to have, such as simple search functionality, class registration, teacher-to-parent messaging, and a schedule-overlayed calendar. With their vision laid out, it was my job to bring it to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sal and Mustafa staked out their competition well before bringing me onboard and discovered the space for innovation is huge: Not a single business for finding after-school activities showed up in Google Search — Only definitions for after-school activity, reasons why aftershool activities are fun, and a few government-run organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was concluded that the closest competition in after-school class discovery was a San Francisco-based startup, called [Kidfully]; it focused on the social aspect of reviewing and sharing after-school activities with fellow parents, a direction similar, but not the same as Afterskoolz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterskoolz would be less about recommendations and building a social community (i.e Kidfully, [Yelp],[Angie’s List]), and more about shopping and registering— making it more similar to traditional shopping sites, such as [Amazon] or even [Grubhub].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterskoolz was built with four types of users: Parents, Teachers, Principals, and Adminsitrators — all with very unique set of needs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The needs of the users determined what functionality the product needed. Many new features were added, while some earlier proposed ideas were reinforced, and other axed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Homepage
================================================== --&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;homepage&quot;&gt;Homepage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The homepage, like in most projects, tends to draw the most input from clients; they usually have a pretty clear vision for how they want to present their product and the atmosphere they want to create for prospective visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, the back-and-forth between myself and the client tends to take far longer than any other aspect of the website’s UI. In designing the Afterskoolz homepage, the main areas of concern from the client was picking a powerful (yet friendly) hero image, a very direct search CTA, and a fun way to list the available classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of solving for the client’s main concerns, I wanted to make sure the homepage got the Afterskoolz branding across in a tasteful, subtle manner. It’s pretty standard in modern design practices for homepages to be: Hero image, CTA, and product selling points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed this formula pretty closely and added illustrations to compliment the various sections. By going relatively simple, the homepage responded down to tablet and mobile very nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a project, you inherently become better and smarter; you know find your mistakes in the first month and so on. However, it is impossible to move forward if you keep looking back. One of the hardest things you can do is say: “Hey, this isn’t perfect. There’s a lot of things I’d like to change now that I know better, but we’ll cross that bridge later.” The main thing is delivering a solid product so it can be developed and launched. That’s why it’s called an MVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The needs of the users determined what functionality the product needed. Many new features were added, while some earlier proposed ideas were reinforced, and other axed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The homepage, like in most projects, tends to draw the most input from clients; they usually have a pretty clear vision for how they want to present their product and the atmosphere they want to create for prospective visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, the back-and-forth between myself and the client tends to take far longer than any other aspect of the website’s UI. In designing the Afterskoolz homepage, the main areas of concern from the client was picking a powerful (yet friendly) hero image, a very direct search CTA, and a fun way to list the available classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of solving for the client’s main concerns, I wanted to make sure the homepage got the Afterskoolz branding across in a tasteful, subtle manner. It’s pretty standard in modern design practices for homepages to be: Hero image, CTA, and product selling points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a project, you inherently become better and smarter; you know find your mistakes in the first month and so on. However, it is impossible to move forward if you keep looking back. One of the hardest things you can do is say: “Hey, this isn’t perfect. There’s a lot of things I’d like to change now that I know better, but we’ll cross that bridge later.” The main thing is delivering a solid product so it can be developed and launched. That’s why it’s called an MVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sal and Mustafa staked out their competition well before bringing me onboard and discovered the space for innovation is huge: Not a single business for finding after-school activities showed up in Google Search — Only definitions for after-school activity, reasons why aftershool activities are fun, and a few government-run organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was concluded that the closest competition in after-school class discovery was a San Francisco-based startup, called [Kidfully]; it focused on the social aspect of reviewing and sharing after-school activities with fellow parents, a direction similar, but not the same as Afterskoolz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, the back-and-forth between myself and the client tends to take far longer than any other aspect of the website’s UI. In designing the Afterskoolz homepage, the main areas of concern from the client was picking a powerful (yet friendly) hero image, a very direct search CTA, and a fun way to list the available classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a project, you inherently become better and smarter; you know find your mistakes in the first month and so on. However, it is impossible to move forward if you keep looking back. One of the hardest things you can do is say: “Hey, this isn’t perfect. There’s a lot of things I’d like to change now that I know better, but we’ll cross that bridge later.” The main thing is delivering a solid product so it can be developed and launched. That’s why it’s called an MVP.&lt;/p&gt;

The Pioneer Press is a collection of 30+ local news websites covering the Chicago suburbs (under the Chicago Sun-Times umbrella) The goal wasn’t simply an aesthetic improvement, but an improvement to the overall product: We made the desktop-only website responsive, added iOS/Android Apps, and created a network to connect them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sal and Mustafa staked out their competition well before bringing me onboard and discovered the space for innovation is huge: Not a single business for finding after-school activities showed up in Google Search — Only definitions for after-school activity, reasons why aftershool activities are fun, and a few government-run organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was concluded that the closest competition in after-school class discovery was a San Francisco-based startup, called [Kidfully]; it focused on the social aspect of reviewing and sharing after-school activities with fellow parents, a direction similar, but not the same as Afterskoolz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterskoolz would be less about recommendations and building a social community (i.e Kidfully, [Yelp],[Angie’s List]), and more about shopping and registering— making it more similar to traditional shopping sites, such as [Amazon] or even [Grubhub].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The needs of the users determined what functionality the product needed. Many new features were added, while some earlier proposed ideas were reinforced, and other axed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Future
================================================== --&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future&quot;&gt;Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a project, you inherently become better and smarter; you know find your mistakes in the first month and so on. However, it is impossible to move forward if you keep looking back. One of the hardest things you can do is say: “Hey, this isn’t perfect. There’s a lot of things I’d like to change now that I know better, but we’ll cross that bridge later.” The main thing is delivering a solid product so it can be developed and launched. That’s why it’s called an MVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, the back-and-forth between myself and the client tends to take far longer than any other aspect of the website’s UI. In designing the Afterskoolz homepage, the main areas of concern from the client was picking a powerful (yet friendly) hero image, a very direct search CTA, and a fun way to list the available classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of solving for the client’s main concerns, I wanted to make sure the homepage got the Afterskoolz branding across in a tasteful, subtle manner. It’s pretty standard in modern design practices for homepages to be: Hero image, CTA, and product selling points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed this formula pretty closely and added illustrations to compliment the various sections. By going relatively simple, the homepage responded down to tablet and mobile very nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
