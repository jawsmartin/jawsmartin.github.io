<!-- Post Main Content
================================================== --> 
<main class="post grid-container-2">
  <p class="sub-header serif">The pivot from strictly local Chicago news to nationwide coverage was finalized when Chicago Sun-Times's parent company sold the Chicago Suburban papers, Pioneer Press, to the Chicago Tribune late 2014.</p>       

<p>The last project I did with Aggrego is most certainly the largest, and for me, the most significant of my career, thus far. I did not expect to be the lead designer of a prestigious product or brand, such as the Chicago Sun-Times, so soon. But, as luck/fortune would have it, I was given the opportunity to not only redesign it, but extend it’s reach across 70 of the largest cities in the US as part of the “Sun-Times Network”</p>

<p>It’s probably fair to say that STN was about a year in-the-making. At Aggrego, we started moving away from in-house projects and more towards business-to-business service. We were managing 30+ news network, Pioneer Press for Chicago Sun-Times’s, laid the foundation for Digicel’s international news network, Loop, and tested multi-county Ireland news network, Today.ie, for Communicorp’s.</p>

<p>Actual start-time for Sun-Times Network began in late August 2014 in which was originally going to be a simply a one-off extension of the Sun-Times brand into Milwaukee, WI. As we started fleshing out the product it started to be apparent that the process for “Milwaukee Sun-Times” could be duplicated as many times as we wanted.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="planningresearch">Planning/Research</h3>

<p>The Sun-Times Network was my first experience working in real corporate environment. I would spend my entire time on the project working alongside industry leaders such Wrapports chairman, Michael Ferro, Wrapports CEO Timothy Knight, Wrapports EVP of Marketing, Julian Posada, and Aggrego CEO, Tim Landon.</p>

<p>With that being said, my contributions to Sun-Times Network began and ended with the direction given to me by this group. As the lead designer of this project, I did my best to propose solutions and ideas, but ultimately, it was my job to carry out their vision.</p>

<p>Going in, the main targets for the Sun-Times Network is as follows:</p>

<figure class="text-left block cf image">
  <img src="/images/post/2015-02-15-the-world-revolves-around-the-sun/mood-board.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">Kidfully, Wyzant, Treehouse, and Amazon inspired Afterskoolz's design</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Afterskoolz would be less about recommendations and building a social community like sites such as Kidfully or Angie’s List, and more about shopping and registering— making it more similar to traditional shopping sites, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> or even <a href="http://www.grubhub.com">Grubhub</a>. </p>

<p>As a 24yr old, single, recent college grad, the platform obviously doesn’t speak to me and my needs, but, it doesn’t take much to understand how such a platform could revolutionize what appears to be a stagnant industry. </p>

<p>Afterskoolz could, potentially, be the go-to destination for parents to browse a large selection of after-school activities in their city and easily, quickly get their children involved; it would completely rid the burden of tradtional paperwork and phone calls, making the process as simple as ever.</p>

<p>What’s even more amazing, is the platform doesn’t have to stop at after-school activities: it could completely replace traditional class registration at every educational level. Take this scenario for example: You just moved to a new city and need to register your child into the new local school. What do you do? You call the school, schedule an appointment, gather identification materials, and physically go to said school to fill out paperwork…why should anyone have to do that in 2015?</p>

<p>While the inital plan for Afterskoolz isn’t quite ready to tackle a terriotry like complete school registration, it is an important aspect to keep in mind for the future, especially as I build my blueprint for the website. I must keep everything I design agile and capable of scaling and accomodating new features/functionaility.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="user-studies">User-Studies</h3>

<p>As I started to build the outline for Afterskools, it was very important, from a high-level, to understand exactly the type of users who would uses it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><img src="/images/icon.png" alt="Alt text" />
<strong>Parents</strong>
<em>Catering to our older, more established audience was not priority. We needed to craft a product that was primarily aimed at younger</em></p>

<strong>Administrators</strong>
<em>Catering to our older, more established audience was not priority. We needed to craft a product that was primarily aimed at younger</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Adding Afterskoolz functionality for children, such as the ability to talk with their classmates and teachers for children was discussed, but shelved for future updates.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="features-and-functionality">Features and Functionality</h3>

<p>Based on these user case-studies, I can figure out which features/functionalities are necessary to satisfy each user’s needs. While the obvious goal is provide every feature these users would desire, it is imporant to discern what is essential and what isn’t. You can always iterate on the product and add feature-after-feature, but you have to make it viable even at it’s simplest; this is especially true in creating a product that can be shipped quickly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><img src="/images/icon.png" alt="Alt text" />
<strong>Search</strong>

<h3 id="site-map">Site Map</h3>

<p>It’s easiest to understand the Sun-Times platform is by looking at it from a bird’s eye view. Each website in the Sun-Times is dedicated to a specific city: Chicago, Milwaukee, New York, etc. that operates completely independent of one-another.</p>

<p>Each Sun-Times network consists of a homepage, an article page template, a dynamic category-front, and weather/traffic widgets. Overall, this is a very basic framework that is easily duplicated across 70 sites.</p>

<p>However, they are all connected through header navigation and a Sun-Times Network homepage, that houses top content from across the entire network.</p>

<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>

<p>After determining how the site is organized and what pages are needed, I define the website’s front-facing visuals. I establish layout, page content, user-interface elements. I also double-check the site’s UX as I work page-to-page. It’s pretty easy to change course or make significant revisions at this step.</p>

<p>The goal of wireframes isn’t to focus on the final product, but to illustrate, at the most basic level, the functionality or purpose of each page. Elements such color and branding are, no doubt, an important part of any website, but they don’t (or shouldn’t, at least) affect how a page/website will work. In my experience, at least, adding these superfluous details only causes distraction.</p>

<h3 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h3>

<p>Prototyping has dramatically changed how I work with clients. In the past, clients and myself would exchange long, winded emails with static .JPEGs. They would look over my images, without context, and use their best judgement to guess how they would work in real life. Sure, a sitemap or wireframe can alleviate the guess-work a bit, but it not quite as intuitive as actually interacting with it.</p>

<figure class="text-left block cf image">
  <img src="/images/post/2015-02-15-the-world-revolves-around-the-sun/prototype.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">It's easy to spot UX flaws when using prototypes</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Besides being a better way for clients to test their potential product, prototyping is also invaulable for testing my designs on multiple devices. I, personally, use <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com">Invison</a> which allows for testing on mobile and tablet, in addition to desktop. It’s extremely helpful to make sure everthing I initially design on a laptop, does in fact, look how I want it on other devices.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="branding-and-logo">Branding and Logo</h3>

<p>Branding Sun-Times was entirely my own endevor. Surprisingly, very little direction was given in branding the new Sun-Times. I distictly rememeber Aggrego CEO, Tim Landon telling me “Just do something the complete opposite of the current Sun-Times. The only restriction is you can’t use red. Michael Ferro hates red.”</p>

<p>So with that being said, I explored a few idea and eventuall settled on a dark color scheme. The idea was that it could both convey a sense of seriousness, and boldness. It also allowed for an expansive color pallette. I was looking for something that would be appropriate for serious and pop culture stories.</p>

<p>I explored several ideas and eventually chose to base the branding off of a chalkboard motif as it pertains to classrooms and students. I liked the idea of scribbled headlines and doodle-style illustrations. I also felt that the dark blue of a chalkboard would work well with a very expansive color palette.</p>

<figure class="text-left block cf image">

  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">The logo was inspired by Toys R' Us, Google, Oreo, and ebay</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For the Afterskoolz logo, I chose a large, slab-serif typeface, <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/chunkfive">Chunkfive</a>, that I felt was playful. I combined it with an another classroom motif, the teacher’s apple. I felt a stylized version of it compliment the wordmark well and could still be strong on its own.</p>

<h3 id="style-guide">Style Guide</h3>

<p>With the branding in order, I translated it into a style guide for the website. I wanted to establish a consistent visual style for color, typography, illustrations, iconograpy, and UI elements.</p>

<figure class="text-left block cf image">
  <img src="/images/post/2015-02-15-the-world-revolves-around-the-sun/style-guide.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">A detailed style guide is very helpful when handing design off to developers</figcaption>

<hr />

<h3 id="homepage">Homepage</h3>

<p>The homepage, like in most projects, tends to draw the most input from clients; they usually have a pretty clear vision for how they want to present their product and the atmosphere they want to create for prospective visitors.</p>

<p>Because of this, the back-and-forth between myself and the client tends to take far longer than any other aspect of the website’s UI. In designing the Afterskoolz homepage, the main areas of concern from Sal and Mustafa was picking a powerful (yet friendly) hero image, a very direct search CTA, and a fun way to list the available classes.</p>

<figure class="text-left block cf image">
  <img src="/images/post/2015-02-15-the-world-revolves-around-the-sun/homepage.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">The relatively-simple homepage design responds down nicely to tablet and mobile</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Outside of solving for their main concerns, I wanted to make sure the homepage got the Afterskoolz branding across in a tasteful, subtle manner— personable, informal copywriting, delightful animations, spot illustrations, and playful iconography. </p>

<p>As far as layout, it’s pretty standard in modern design practices for homepages to be: Hero image, product selling points, website section highlights, and CTA. I followed this formula pretty closely.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="article-page">Article Page</h3>

<p>The search-results page, in my opinion, is the most important page of the entire site; you want it to coney a large amount of information in a simple, unintimidating way. At the same time, you want to give users the ability to access a large varitey of additional details and search customization if needed.</p>

<figure class="text-left block cf image">

  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">Sal and Mustafa stressed the importance of a map and save-class buttons in the page's design</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr />

<h3 id="category-front">Category Front</h3>

<p>The class profile page is divided into 3 sections: details, endorsements, and schedule. The Details section elaborates on information showed initially in the search results, the Endorsements section showcases administrator-selected class recommendations (NOT Yelp-style reviews), and the schedule section presents all available sessions for enrollment.</p>

<h3 id="ios-mobile-app">iOS Mobile App</h3>

<p>As I’ve stated before, Afterskoolz isn’t just about discovery and registration— it has a wide assortment of tools and functionality, each tailored for its three types of users (4 if you include administrators) For example, parents need the ability to manage their children’s schedules, teachers need to send homework to students, principals need to manage rosters.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Over the course of a project, you inherently become better and smarter; you tend to find your mistakes from the first month and the second month and so on. However, it is impossible to move forward if you keep looking back. One of the hardest things to do is say: “Hey, this isn’t perfect. There’s a lot of things I’d like to change now that I know better, but we’ll cross that bridge later.” The main thing is delivering a solid product so it can be developed and launched. That’s why it’s called an MVP.</p>

<p>That being said, after about four months of working on Afterskoolz, there is definitely areas I would like to revist and improve. Specifically, I’d like to improve main/sub navigation, redesign search results page, expand branding color palette, and add stronger illustrations.</p>

<p>We worked on the Sun-Times Network nonstop from the time project was started until the MVP was launched at 6pm on October 31st. The project, for-better-or-for-worse, was defined as an MVP. As a small tech team of about 6 people, we were rushing to complete the project by the chosen deadline. As such, there were bugs aplenty. Our ad servers were working incorrectly, embedded videos broke layouts, responsiveness was broken on mobile, and the list goes on.</p>

<p>That being said, as a collective, we were extremely happy the product was finally live and we wasted no time iterating the necessary fixes and working to improve the platform</p>

<p>I decided to move on from Aggrego following the completion of Sun-Times Network V.2. While I was extremely happy with what I accomplished, I learned that the digital news media game wasn’t for me. I didn’t take pleasure in the type of content we were producing, or the advertisements we were covering our website in. I also learned that the corporate environment wasn’t for me.</p>

<p>In my final two weeks with Aggrego, I prepped the gameplan for Sun-Times V.3, focusing on improving the article page and homepage.</p>

<p>As of January, 2015, the proposed changes were not implemented.</p>
