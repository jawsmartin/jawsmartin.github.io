  <p class="sub-header serif">While seemingly not a large step for most, moving from an Local + FTP setup to Github marks a most substantial step forward for my web development career</p>       

<p>It’s not every day you get to design a product for entire countries like Jamaica and Haiti, so when Aggrego was brought in to design the digital news network, “Loop”, in Spring 2014, I was definitely excited. Digicel, a communications company that handles phones in the Carribean, wanted to capitalize on their significant involment in their customers’ lives by creating the ultimate source.</p>

<h3 id="planningresearch">Planning/Research</h3>

<p>Sal and Mustafa staked out their competition well before bringing me onboard and discovered the space for innovation is huge: Not a single business for finding after-school activities will show up in a Google Search for “After-school activities for kids” — Only listicles/articles on suggested ideas, a few local businesses, and nationwide, government-created programs. Not a single platform for searching or registering or shopping for activities/classes. Crazy, right?</p>

<p>Sal and Mustafa concluded that only competition in after-school class discovery was a small San Francisco-based startup, called <a href="http://www.kidfully.com">Kidfully</a>; it focused on the social aspect of reviewing and sharing after-school activities with fellow parents in the SF area; this is a direction similar, but not the same as intended for Afterskoolz.</p>

<figure class=" text-left block cf image">
  <img src="/images/post-soccer-moms-rejoice-inspiration.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">Kidfully, Wyzant, Treehouse, and Amazon inspired Afterskoolz's design </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Afterskoolz would be less about recommendations and building a social community like sites such as Kidfully and Angie’s List), and more about shopping and registering— making it more similar to traditional shopping sites, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> or even <a href="http://www.grubhub.com">Grubhub</a>. </p>

<p>As a 24yr old, single, recent college grad, the platform obviously doesn’t speak to me and my needs. But, it doesn’t take much to understand how such a platform could revolutionize what appears to be a stagnant industry. </p>

<p>Afterskoolz could, potentially, be the go-to destination for parents to browse a large selection of after-school activities and easily, quickly get their children involved; it would completely rid the burden of tradtional paperwork and phone calls, making the process as simple as ever.</p>

<p>What’s even more amazing, is the platform doesn’t have to stop at afterschool activities: it could completely replace traditional class registration at every educational level. Take this scenario for example: You just moved to a new city and need to register your child into the new local school. What do you do? You call the school, register an appointment, gather identification materials, and physically go to said school to fill out paperwork.</p>

<p>Those are extremely inconvenient, but easily solvable problems. It was an important aspect to keep in mind as I built my blueprint for Afterskoolz: searching and registering is only the beginning on what could be a multifunctional platform.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="user-studies">User-Studies</h3>

<p>As I started to build the outline for Afterskools, it was very important, from a high-level, to understand exactly the type of users who would uses it.</p>

<figure class=" text-left block cf image">
  <img src="/images/post-soccer-moms-rejoice-background.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">Afterskoolz has three users: Parents, Teachers, and Principals</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="features-and-functionality">Features and Functionality</h3>

<p>Based on these User-Cases, I can figure out which features/functionality is necessary to satisfy each user’s needs. While the goal is provide every feature these users would desire, it is imporant to discern what is essential and what isn’t. You can always iterate on the product and add feature-after-feature, but you have to make it viable even at it’s simplest; this is especially true in creating a product that can be shipped quickly.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="site-map">Site Map</h3>

<p>It’s easiest to understand the Afterskoolz platform by looking at it from a bird’s eye view; it is extremely multifunctional: It acts as a public-facing discovery tool, a e-commerce platform, a private organization service, a communication interface, and a management aid. All of these functions differ in one way or another from user-to-user. It can get quite confusing if it is not planned and organized properly.</p>

</figure>

<hr />

<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>

<p>After determining how the site is organized and what pages are needed, I define the website’s front-facing visuals. I establish layout, page content, user-interface elements. I also double-check the site’s UX as I work page-to-page. It’s pretty easy to change course or make significant revisions at this step.</p>

<p>The goal of the wireframes isn’t to focus on the final product; things like color and branding will only cause unnecessary conversation that is best saved for later.</p>

<h3 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h3>

<p>Prototyping has dramatically changed how I work with clients. In the past, clients and myself would exchange long, winded emails with static .JPEGs. They would look over my images, without context, and use their best judgement to guess how it would work in real life. Sure, a sitemap or wireframe can alleviate the guess work a bit, but it not quite as intuitive as actually interacting with it.</p>

<figure class=" text-left block cf image">
  <img src="/images/post-soccer-moms-rejoice-background.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">It's easy to spot UX flaws when using prototypes</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Besides being a better way for clients to test their potential product, prototyping is also invaulable for testing your designs on multiple devices. I personally use <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com">Invison</a> which allows for testing on mobile and tablet, in addition to desktop. It’s extremely helpful to make sure everthing I initially design on a laptop, does in fact, look how I want it on other devices.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="branding-and-logo">Branding and Logo</h3>

<p>In addition to my involvement in the web design process, I also worked heaviliy in branding. Sal and Mustafa came to me with the “Afterskoolz” name and some general direction: they wanted it to be “fun and friendly,” emphasize color, and, in no way, be confused with a corporate business.</p>

<p>I explored several ideas and eventually chose to base the branding off of a chalkboard motif as it pertains to classrooms and students. I liked the idea of scribbled headlines and doodle-style illustrations. I also felt that the dark blue of a chalkboard would work well with a very colorful color palette.</p>

<figure class=" text-left block cf image">
  <img src="/images/post-soccer-moms-rejoice-logo.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">The logo was inspired by Toys R' Us, Google, Oreo, and ebay</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For the Afterskoolz logo, I chose a large, slab-serif typeface <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/chunkfive">Chunkfive</a> that I felt was playful. I combined it with an another classroom motif, the teacher’s apple. I felt a stylized version of it compliment the wordmark well and still be strong on its own.</p>

</figure>

<hr />

<h3 id="style-guide">Style Guide</h3>

<p>With the branding in order, I translated it into a style guide for the website. I wanted to establish a consistent visual style for color, illustrations, iconograpy, and UI elements.</p>

<figure class=" text-left block cf image">

  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">Alleyoop looks great on your phone</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr />

<h3 id="homepage">Homepage</h3>

<p>The homepage, like in most projects, tends to draw the most input from clients; they usually have a pretty clear vision for how they want to present their product and the atmosphere they want to create for prospective visitors.</p>

<p>Because of this, the back-and-forth between myself and the client tends to take far longer than any other aspect of the website’s UI. In designing the Afterskoolz homepage, the main areas of concern from Sal and Mustafa was picking a powerful (yet friendly) hero image, a very direct search CTA, and a fun way to list the available classes.</p>

<figure class=" text-left block cf image">
  <img src="/images/post-soccer-moms-rejoice-homepage.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">Alleyoop looks great on your phone</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Outside of solving for their main concerns, I wanted to make sure the homepage got the Afterskoolz branding across in a tasteful, subtle manner. It’s pretty standard in modern design practices for homepages to be: Hero image, CTA, and product selling points.</p>

<p>I followed this formula pretty closely and added illustrations to compliment the various sections. By going relatively simple, the homepage responded down to tablet and mobile very nicely.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="search-results">Search Results</h3>

<p>The search-results page, in my opinion, is the most important page of the entire site. You want to coney a large amount of information in a simple, unintimidating way. At the same time, you want to give users the ability to access a large varitey of additional details and search customization if needed.</p>

<figure class=" text-left block cf image">
  <img src="/images/post-soccer-moms-rejoice-homepage.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">Alleyoop looks great on your phone</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr />

<h3 id="class-details">Class Details</h3>

<p>The class details page is divided into 3 sections: details, endorsements, and schedule. Details elaborates on information showed initially in the search results, Endorsements showcases administrator-selected class recommendations (NOT Yelp-style reviews), and schedule displays available sessions for enrollment.</p>

  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">Alleyoop looks great on your phone</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr />

<h3 id="dashboard">Dashboard</h3>

<p>As I’ve stated before, Afterskoolz isn’t just about discovery and registration— it has a wide assortment of tools and functionality. Each of the three types of users (4 if you include administrators) has a different set of needs and the dashboard is customized to fit each one. For example, parents need the ability to manage their children’s schedules, teachers need to send homework to students, principals need to manage rosters, and</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Over the course of a project, you inherently become better and smarter; you tend to find your mistakes from the first month and the second month and so on. However, it is impossible to move forward if you keep looking back. One of the hardest things to do is say: “Hey, this isn’t perfect. There’s a lot of things I’d like to change now that I know better, but we’ll cross that bridge later.” The main thing is delivering a solid product so it can be developed and launched. That’s why it’s called an MVP.</p>

<p>That being said, after about four months of working on Afterskoolz, there is definitely areas I would like to revist and improve. Specifically, I’d like to improve main/sub navigation, redesign search results page, expand branding color palette, and add stronger illustrations.</p>

<p>While I have a lot of things I’d like to improve about Afterskoolz, I am, overall, very proud of the product I helped build; I believe it has bright future.</p>

<p>At the moment I am writing this case-study, my designs are being handed over to developers with the hope that an Afterskoolz MVP (limited to Chicago-only) will be launched Summer 2015. I have also been working with Sal and Mustafa on possible social networking features, dedicated mobile apps, and API-based widgets.</p>
