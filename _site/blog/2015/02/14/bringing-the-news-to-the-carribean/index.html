          <h3>Planning/Research</h3> 
          <p class="cs-copy">Sal and Mustafa staked out their competition well before bringing me onboard and discovered the space for innovation is huge: Not a single business for finding after-school activities showed up in Google Search &mdash; Only definitions for after-school activity, reasons why aftershool activities are fun, and a few government-run organizations.</p>         
          <p class="cs-copy">It was concluded that the closest competition in after-school class discovery was a San Francisco-based startup, called <a href="https://www.kidfully.com" class="link text-link" target="_blank">Kidfully</a>; it focused on the social aspect of reviewing and sharing after-school activities with fellow parents, a direction similar, but not the same as Afterskoolz.</p> 
          <p class="cs-copy">Afterskoolz would be less about recommendations and building a social community (i.e Kidfully, <a href="https://www.yelp.com" class="link text-link" target="_blank">Yelp</a>, <a href="https://www.angieslist.com" class="link text-link" target="_blank">Angie's List</a>), and more about shopping and registering&mdash; making it more similar to traditional shopping sites, such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com" class="link text-link" target="_blank">Amazon</a> or even <a href="https://www.grubhub.com" class="link text-link" target="_blank">Grubhub</a>.</p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3> 
          <p class="cs-copy">The timeframe for this project was aproximately late July, 2014 to Mid November, 2014. We had originally planned for only a non-responsive desktop experience built only search-and-register functionality. Over the course of the four months, the scope gradually increased&mdash; adding responsiveness, as well as a wide array of backend tool for users. By the end of the process, Afterskoolz became a multifunctional platform for not only parents, but teachers and principals.</p>      
          <p class="cs-copy">All-in-all, I'm very happy with the direction I created for Sal and Mustafa; I believe we nailed down the fundamentals of their product and have left room for it to grow. As in all the projects, there are specifics I</p>

          <h3>Future</h3> 
          <p class="cs-copy">Over the course of a project, you inherently become better and smarter; you know find your mistakes in the first month and so on. However, it is impossible to move forward if you keep looking back. One of the hardest things you can do is say: "Hey, this isn't perfect. There's a lot of things I'd like to change now that I know better, but we'll cross that bridge later." The main thing is delivering a solid product so it can be developed and launched. That's why it's called an MVP.</p>      
          <p class="cs-copy">But, that's not to say I didn't put together ideas for Afterskoolz V.2. One of things I wanted to improve was the homepage, overall color variety, navigation, and search funtionality.</p>
