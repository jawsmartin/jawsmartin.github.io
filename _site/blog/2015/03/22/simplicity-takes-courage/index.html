      <p>One of the aspects of design that has not only intrigued me, but has since become a personal professional mantra, is the idea of minimalism. While on the surface, this idea of minimalism is simplicity and liberation from clutter seems like a consensus objective, it’s fair to say effort towards it is not very visible: everything in our culture is bloated and in excess. But, I don’t think that it is from a lack of trying.</p>

<p>Simplicity, in definition is uncomplicated, or uncompounded— lacking all that is not absolutely necessary. In such a state, one isn’t left with much to protect themselves. You are at your most vulnerable.</p>

<p>I think because of this vulnerability we try to compensa It’s easy to see those that have overcome this anxiety and producded confident, bold work. It stand out. I always joke that the more confident you are, the less you care about what others think. It’s pretty funny to see industry leaders, have simple HTML one-line websites.</p>

<p>At the same time, I don’t think you can simple duplicate the aethetic or mindset effectively without fully understanding or appreciating it. I think that’s why minimalistic, “flat” design is so quickly adopted by web design beginners. They see that professionals are doing it, so they replicate it. This creates a false sense of confience. I liken it to buying a high-turbo car that you buy simple because it looks cool. Not knowing how its supposed to be used.</p>

<p>Reduction, prioritize and remove the superfluous, restraint</p>

<p>I know it’s something I struggle with. This website you are looking at now has been a WIP for the entire two years I’ve been coding. I go through neverending process of adding a lot of information and design in hopes of convincing visitors I know what I’m doing or to impress them, then I say fuck it, I don’t care about them…then taking aways superfluous elements until I am left with the bare minimum…then I get self-concious and add them all back….then I take them away again. I worry, “Do I not have enough animations? I don’t have a hero image. I need better photography. I need a professional profile picture. How do I add parallax to my site. What about this feature?” It can get extremely overwhelming. Especially when none of that is the true purpose of the site.</p>

<p>I want to get across to others that I know what I’m doing. It takes extreme confidence and restraint to leave it be and proudly display what you have and who you are.</p>
