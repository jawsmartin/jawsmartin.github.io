  <p class="sub-header serif">It can be comforting to surround yourself and your work with floruishes and excess to display to others your worth or value. It takes supreme confidence to show yourself off to the world with little to nothing to shield you from criticism.</p>       

<p>One of the aspects of design that has not only intrigued me, but has since become a personal professional mantra, is the idea of minimalism. While on the surface, this idea of minimalism is simplicity and liberation from clutter seems like a consensus objective, it’s fair to say effort towards it is not very visible: everything in our culture is bloated and in excess. But, I don’t think that it is from a lack of trying.</p>

<p>Simplicity, in definition is uncomplicated, or uncompounded— lacking all that is not absolutely necessary. In such a state, one isn’t left with much to protect themselves. You are at your most vulnerable.</p>

<p>I think because of this vulnerability we try to compensa</p>

<p>It’s easy to see those that have overcome this anxiety and producded confident, bold work. It stand out.</p>

<p>I always joke that the more confident you are, the less you care about what others think. It’s pretty funny to see industry leaders, have simple HTML one-line websites.</p>

<p>At the same time, I don’t think you can simple duplicate the aethetic or mindset effectively without fully understanding or appreciating it. I think that’s why minimalistic, “flat” design is so quickly adopted by web design beginners. They see that professionals are doing it, so they replicate it. This creates a false sense of confience. I liken it to buying a high-turbo car that you buy simple because it looks cool. Not knowing how its supposed to be used.</p>

<p>Reduction, prioritize and remove the superfluous, restraint</p>

<p>I know it’s something I struggle with. This website you are looking at now has been a WIP for the entire two years I’ve been coding. I go through neverending process of adding a lot of information and design in hopes of convincing visitors I know what I’m doing or to impress them, then I say fuck it, I don’t care about them…then taking aways superfluous elements until I am left with the bare minimum…then I get self-concious and add them all back….then I take them away again. I worry, “Do I not have enough animations? I don’t have a hero image. I need better photography. I need a professional profile picture. How do I add parallax to my site. What about this feature?” It can get extremely overwhelming. Especially when none of that is the true purpose of the site.</p>

<p>I want to get across to others that I know what I’m doing. It takes extreme confidence and restraint to leave it be and proudly display what you have and who you are.</p>
