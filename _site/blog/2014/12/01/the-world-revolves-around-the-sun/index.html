        <p>The last project I did with Aggrego is most certainly the largest, and for me, up until that momement, the most significant of my career. I was given the opportunity to redesign the Chicago Sun-Times and extend the brand across websites and apps in 70 of the largest cities in the US as part of the “Sun-Times Network.”</p>

<p>Aggrego, the company I was technically employed by for this project, is generally a software development startup that creates and manages news media networks. It employees a extremely talented mix of developers and engineers who build the networks from the ground up, and content creators who fill said networks with highly-monetizable content. </p>

<p>During my tenure with Aggrego, we worked on a wide range of inhouse projects, such as Weekaway and Rankommend, but focused primarily on building for others. A few of our client projects include managing Sun-Times Media Group’s Chicago suburb news network, Pioneer Press, building Digicel’s international news network, Loop, and testing Communicorp’s multi-county Ireland news network, Today.ie.</p>

<p>The <strong>Sun-Times Network</strong> would be another of these client projects.</p>

<p>It was proposed by Sun-Times Media Group’s owner, Wrapports, LLC, as a one-off extention of the Chicago Sun-Times brand into Milwaukee, WI. However, as we started mapping out the product it started to be apparent that the process for “Milwaukee Sun-Times” could be duplicated infinitely, assuming we could create a scalable template.</p>

<p>The Sun-Times Network was my first experience working in real corporate environment. I would spend my entire time on the project working alongside many established news industry figures such Wrapports chairman, Michael Ferro, Wrapports CEO Timothy Knight, Wrapports EVP of Marketing, Julian Posada, and Aggrego CEO, Tim Landon.</p>

<p>With that being said, my contributions to planning/researching for Sun-Times Network began and ended with the direction given to me by this group. As the lead designer of this project, I proposed solutions and ideas, but ultimately, it was my job to carry out their vision.</p>

<p>Up front, the general conscensus was that the product needed to be “younger”, “hipper”, “trendier”, and a host of other buzz words. More-or-less, they wanted the product to be the <strong>exact opposite</strong> of the current Chicago Sun-Times. With that being said, comparisions to Twitter and Buzzfeed were tossed around frequently.</p>

<p>Aggregate content
Built on Social
Emphasis on apps</p>

<p>The gaol was to create a platform that could engaging content that is extremely shareable. </p>

<p>As I said before, in a project this scale and working with so many high-level voices, my input, for better-or-for-worse was taken with a grain of salt. Personally/Professionally, I would have put more emphasis catering functionaility, features, to Chicago Sun-Times’s established user-base to better acclimated them to the new platform.</p>

<p>While that is my opinion, I do not necessarily think out approach to completely pivot in a new direction was a bad decision. Instead of a “hold your hand” approach, we were able to build a platform with having to compromise any of the project’s main goals, whch was first-and-foremost, build a dynamic, brand new platform</p>

<p>Branding Sun-Times was entirely my own endevor. Surprisingly, very little direction was given in branding the new Sun-Times. I distictly rememeber Aggrego CEO, Tim Landon telling me “Just do something the complete opposite of the current Sun-Times. The only restriction is you can’t use red. Michael Ferro hates red.”</p>

<p>So with that being said, I explored a few idea and eventuall settled on a dark color scheme. The idea was that it could both convey a sense of seriousness, and boldness. It also allowed for an expansive color pallette. I was looking for something that would be appropriate for serious and pop culture stories.</p>

<p>When I first joined Aggrego, the company identified itself as a startup. The general atmosphere was exciting as we seemed to be moving project-to-project.</p>

<p>However, as we progressed with the Sun-Times Network, it became increasingly apparent what the priorities were and it was to create an amazing, game-changing product. While I’ve learned the monetization is iand pleasing those who have the money is extremely important, I didn’t feel comfortable producing a product I would never use myself.</p>

<figure class="text-left block cf image">
  <img src="/images/post/2014-12-01-the-world-revolves-around-the-sun/homepage.jpg" alt="Users have all of their tools and information readily available in their dashboards" />
  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">Users have all of their tools and information readily available in their dashboards</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The entire project became “How many pageviews?” and “Where can we stick a banner ad?”. This was literally the only things talked about. Product Design was an extremely low-priority as my contributions became more about “Photoshopping” graphics and ideas that product managers and sales couldn’t do themselves. The level of innovation was as low as you could imagine. It became “copy what they did over there and put our logo on it”</p>

<p>While I obviously upset with the direction Sun-Times took, that is not to say I wasn’t proud of my contributions and the wonderful people I worked with in the trenches. We built an amazing product very, very quickly.</p>

<p>I decided to move on from Aggrego following the completion of Sun-Times Network V.2. While I was extremely happy with what I accomplished, I learned that the digital news media game wasn’t for me. I didn’t take pleasure in the type of content we were producing, or the advertisements we were covering our website in. I also learned that the corporate environment wasn’t for me.</p>

<p>In my final two weeks with Aggrego, I prepped the gameplan for Sun-Times V.3, focusing on improving the article page and homepage.</p>
