        <p>My love of Dribbble is well-documented. As a designer and illustrator, I use the platform regualry as an inspiration and refernce tool. It has some of the most talented professionals on the platform sharing all of their work. Is is a wonderful tool in many ways. With that being said, it’s not perfect; there are many features </p>

<p>The tool we came up with was Bbbbench. It would be a bookmarking website in which you could take artist you follow and divide them up into unqiue groups for quick referencing. </p>

<p>We worked on Bbbench, off-and-on, for about 2 months. I would draw up the interfaces and ux, and Beckman would put it together. With the intention that the product could be very useful, I spent some extra time working on its branding. I made very complext illustrations for it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while were working on Bbbench, we noticed that Dribbble, did in fact, have a “List” feature for organizing artists you follow. This put an obvious crack in our plans and we stopped working on it.</p>

<p>I have discussed with Beckman the possible pivot from web app to browers widget that could still make the quick referencing functionality of Bbbench still viable, but we have yet to take action on it.</p>

<p>The project was fun nonetheless and a good exercise in creating a product from the ground up. It also gives perspective on the cutthroat startup culture where your next “big idea” is probably already being made by a dozen other people.</p>
