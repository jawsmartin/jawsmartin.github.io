        <p>Josh asked me to refresh Hummingbird’s logo (which is a standalone icon, no type). He felt his current version had too jagged of contour lines, too many details and didn’t work at a small scale.</p>

<figure class="text-left block cf image">

  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">Hummingbird's current logo</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For direction, Josh pointed me to Jord Riekwel’s <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/370581-Hummingbird">Hummingbird</a>, a logo he tried to purchase unsuccessfully prior to bringing me in.</p>

<figure class="text-left block cf image">

  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">Jord Riekwel's Hummingbird logo</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I would characterize the desired icon as clean and minimal with sharp details; it is definitely strong enough to stand on its own, as well as be recognizable at any size.</p>

<p>While Josh asked for an icon very similar to Riekwel’s, I wanted to make sure the direction I took was still unique, and most importantly different enough that the two marks could exist without stepping on each others’ wings.</p>

<p>When I started exploring ideas for the logo, I knew from the start that I wanted it to be bold and strong. I experimented with lots of curves and sharp angles, cutting away at the overlapping sections where the tail and tail meet the body.</p>

  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">Proposed directions</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We ended up going with my second favorite direction (my first being a Japanese Rising Sun-inspired one) and it was probably the most straightforward merge of Jord’s logo and Josh’s: I took the general shape of Jord’s and accentuated the wings and feathers with details similar to what Josh originally had. I also elongated and contorted it’s body to suggest movement.</p>

<p>I put an emphasis to making the curves and angles exaggerated to give it the stronger look I was aiming for. I made its beak thick and hyperbolic for better legibility at smaller sizes.</p>

  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">Hummingbird's new logo</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Overall, I’m very happy with how the logo turned out. I knew when taking on the project that I was walking a fine line in terms of how similar Josh wanted the logo to be to Jord’s, but I’m confident that we came up with a unique treatment.</p>

<p>Seeing the logo outside of a thumbnail also reinforces that it is its own identity, too. It has really taken on a personality all its own since I handed it off. I’ve seen it on t-shirts, wallpapers, cover photos, avatars…everywhere in all sorts of variations. It’s pretty cool.</p>
