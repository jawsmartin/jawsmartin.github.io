      <section class="post">
        <p>My very talented friend and founder or Hummingbird, <a href="https://twitter.com/joshfabian">Josh Fabian</a>, asked me to refresh its logo to coincide with a large website redesign. He felt his current version had a jagged silhouette and too fine of details that didn’t work at a small scale. A new logo was needed to reflect the website’s new direction and the bright future Hummingbird was working towards.</p>

<figure class="text-left block cf image">

  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">Hummingbird's current logo</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="process">Process</h3>

<p>For direction, Josh pointed me to Jord Riekwel’s <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/370581-Hummingbird">Hummingbird</a>, a logo he tried to purchase unsuccessfully prior to bringing me in.</p>

<figure class="text-left block cf image">

  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">Jord Riekwel's Hummingbird logo</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I would characterize the desired icon as clean and minimal with sharp details; it is definitely strong enough to stand on its own, as well as be recognizable at any size. It’s relatively similar in style to what Josh had, but with a more simplified outline.</p>

<p>My job more-or-less, was to find a middle-ground between the two.</p>

<p>While Josh asked for an icon leaning closer in design to Riekwel’s, I wanted to make sure the direction I took was still unique, and most importantly different enough that the two marks could exist without stepping on each others’ wings.</p>

<p>When I started exploring ideas for the logo, I knew from the start that I wanted it to be bold and strong as, it alone, would need to be a symbol for an entire community.</p>

<p>I experimented with lots of curves and sharp angles, cutting away at the overlapping sections where the tail and tail meet the body.</p>

  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">Proposed directions</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After presenting a number of options, we ended up going with my second favorite direction (my first being a Japanese ‘Rising Sun’ inspired one) and it was probably the most straightforward merge of Jord’s logo and Josh’s.</p>

<p>I took the general shape of Jord’s and accentuated the wings and feathers with details similar to what Josh originally had, as well as elongating and contorting it’s body to suggest movement.</p>

<p>I also put an emphasis on making the curves and angles exaggerated to give it the stronger look I was aiming for. I made its beak thick and exaggerated for better readability at smaller sizes.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Overall, I’m very happy with how the logo turned out. I knew when taking on the project that I was walking a fine line in terms of how similar Josh wanted the logo to be to Jord’s, but I’m confident that we came up with a unique treatment.</p>

<p>As an artist, (for at least me anyways) I stake claim to anything I do or make as 100% mine — I came up with the perfect idea all on my own, with no one’s help.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately, that’s rarely the case. You take little bits here and an idea there, and rearrange them strategically until the end result is unique enough to call your own.</p>

<p>Sometimes you do this willingly by visiting your favorite websites or projects for inspiration, or sometimes, as in this case and most, it’s straightup asked that you make something similar.</p>

</figure>

<p>I feel such a situation is normal and the process is acceptable as long as nothing is a flat-out copied. Everything you make needs to have more of your fingerprints on it than anyone else’s.</p>

<h3 id="in-the-wild">In the wild</h3>

<p>The logo has really taken on a personality all its own since I handed it off. I’ve seen it on t-shirts, wallpapers, cover photos, avatars…everywhere in all sorts of variations. It’s pretty cool; I’m very glad the community has embraced it.</p>
