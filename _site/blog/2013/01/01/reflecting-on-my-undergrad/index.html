      <!-- Post Main Content
      ================================================== --> 
      <section class="post">
        <p>I went to college at Edinboro University, a liberal arts college in northwestern Pennsylania that is highly regarded for its teaching and arts programs.</p>

<p>I admittedly half-assed my way there. Unlike most (seemingly), I was quite unsure what I was going to do after High School. I  <em>knew</em> I had to go college, but where and for what was couldn’t have been further from my mind. I knew I liked art and writing; I’ve been drawing and writing stories since I knew how to hold a pencil (Reading and collecting Goosebumps books as a kid, then trying to create my own, was probably where it all started)</p>

  <figcaption class="text-small" align="bottom">I was a member of the goosebumps book club</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But, as the adage goes, you can’t make money as an artist (or writer) and as such, never took my those interests as anymore than a hobby. I figured that the most sensible thing would be to buckle down and pick something straight-laced and dependable, such as teaching or business.</p>

<p>So, my senior year of High School, I took every generic business class I could find: accounting, marketing, public speaking, business essentials and applied for whatever colleges my friends were going to. (At the time, the big 3 choices were Clarion University, St. Vincent University, and IUP)</p>

<p>Things were seemingly on the right path until, like most stories worth telling, I met a girl. This particular girl was every bit as artsy as me (but way, way more talented) and she was totally going to pursue it seriously. It was a pretty significant in that it motivated me to do the same. Why be a vanilla, white bread businessman when I can draw/write for a living? Hell, maybe I won’t make much, but who knows.</p>

<p>So, long story short, I ditched the “safe and sensible” plan and hopped on “let’s follow this girl to the frozen tundra of northwestern PA and do artsy stuff” train.</p>

<p>It all worked out, fortunately, but it’s pretty ridiculous how nonchalant I was about making such a huge pivot. I’m pretty sure I put in my application to Edinboro only a few months before graduating without even knowing anything other than it’s a “great art school” and said girl would be there. </p>

<p>So ridiculous.</p>

<p>Anyways, At Edinboro, I came in thinking my love of drawing and writing would translate very well to traditional animation. The program involved not only a base of essential foundation classes to make me a better, faster drawer, but it put me for the first time, in an environment surrounded by those just like me. We all liked drawing and storytelling.</p>

<p>While I enjoyed aspects of the program, traditional animation, as a whole wasn’t for me. Storyboard was great, creating characters was great, but sitting in a basement on a lighttable for 8hrs at a time wasn’t. I absolutelhy <em>dreaded</em> the process of frame-by-frame drawing, then uploading them to a computer one-by-one, then trying to sync audio. It was hell. I remember thinking “I’m not supposed to hate my major. Soemthing is wrong here.”</p>

<p>At the time this was going down, I was playing with Adobe Photoshop CS2. I had no idea how to use it. MY only prior experience was Microsoft Paint. This meant I only knew how to use the paintbrush tool (I eventually learned the eyedropper and zoom tool).</p>

<p>I was hooked</p>

<p>I’d spend <em>hours</em> just staring at this computer screen coloring in my drawings. I’d zoom in to 1600% to try to make straight clean curves/lines.</p>

<p>Hilariously, I didn’t know the difference between a .JPG and a .PSD file, so I naturally used .JPG when saving and when I reopened the file and zoomed in again, all my neat lines I took forever to make, were pixelated. I also didn’t know what Layers were. This was all one giant flat image.</p>

<p>Like a guy checking out a girl at a bar while already in a relationship, I took a graphic design class on the side just to see if it got any better.</p>

<p>And it did.</p>

<p>I took a “Intro to Graphic Design” course with a very amazing teacher, Brigett Davitt, who sparked what would eventually</p>

<p>A few of my favorite projects from my undergrad.</p>

<p>The excitement for MyTown variations of the Pioneer Press was short-lived however.
After launching the newly redesigned Pioneer Press Site, we stepped away from it, momentarilary, to focus on building Loop and Today.ie, but revisited it a few months later. When we started back up with Pioneer Press, the objective was to add dedicated iOS and Android Apps.</p>
