        <p><em>NOTE: This post is dated Jan 2013, but was written in Mar 2015. I wish I had wrote about this part of my life as it actually happened, but I didn’t think to. This blog, while sometimes spur of the moment, is more or less, an honest timeline of my life personally and professionally. When I finally decided to taking writing seriously, I wanted to make sure it was thorough and not just hacked together. With that in mind, I’ve been going back and highlighting important moments, like this one, to build a more complete narrative.</em> </p>

<p>I went to college at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, a liberal arts college in northwestern Pennsylania that is highly regarded for its teaching and arts programs.</p>

<p>I admittedly half-assed my way there. Unlike most, seemingly, I was quite unsure what I was going to do after High School. I  <em>knew</em> I had to go college, but where and for what was never apparent. I knew I liked art. I’ve been drawing since I knew how to hold a pencil. I’ve been the “artsy” kid in every class I ever had. </p>

<p>But, as the adage goes, you can’t make money as an artist. I treated it as a hobby for the most part think I had no future in it. My senior year of High School, I took every generic business class I could find: accounting, marketing, public speaking, business essentials… I figured </p>

<p>A few of my favorite projects from my undergrad.</p>

<p>The excitement for MyTown variations of the Pioneer Press was short-lived however.
After launching the newly redesigned Pioneer Press Site, we stepped away from it, momentarilary, to focus on building Loop and Today.ie, but revisited it a few months later. When we started back up with Pioneer Press, the objective was to add dedicated iOS and Android Apps.</p>
