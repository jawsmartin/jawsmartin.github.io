              <p class="excerpt">One of the aspects of design that has not only intrigued me, but has since become a personal professional mantra, is the idea of minimalism. While on the surface, this idea of minimalism is simplicity and liberation from clutter seems like a consensus objective, it’s fair to say effort towards it is not very visible: everything in our culture is bloated and in excess. But, I don’t think that it is from a lack of trying.

              <p class="excerpt">It’s a little cathartic to reflect on your career with a sense of entitlement. You take credit when things went well, chalking it up to your grandeous contributions and you denounce all that went poorly to circumstances that were out of your hands. It is a very unhealthy perspective that I, admittedly, struggle with. While not easy in the slightest, I’ve been making a concerted effort to correct it.

The is ridiculous in itself because Barrymore, at the time 25, is clearly, obviously much older than then the students she is pretending to fit in with.

I did not expect to be the lead designer of a prestigious product or brand, such as the Chicago Sun-Times, so soon. But, as luck/fortune would have it, I was given the opportunity to not only redesign it, but extend it’s reach across 70 of the largest cities in the US as part of the “Sun-Times Network”

He wanted something in the style close to Hummingbird: Thin contour lines and sharp details. It was important that the logo work at small and large scales, and black and white.

I never got a raise, asked for raise, or expected a raise. I just clocked in, worked my 40hrs, hoped for overttime, and clocked out. So, when I sheepishly asked for $15/hr for my first web design and development job...and got it, I was a little more than estatic.</p>
