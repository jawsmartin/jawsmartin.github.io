<h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I am a Designer, Illustrator, and Front-End Developer from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania living in Chicago, Illinois. I currently work as an independent product designer for local startups.</p>

<p>I also manage a variety of <a href="http://www.behance.net.jawsmartin">projects</a>, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjL5u_8BlgY">cheesy horror movies</a>, hang out at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHDOpKYqCGo">Arcades</a>, and listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEaml0KMkVQ">loud music</a>.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>I love to learn and get distracted easily, which is most definitely a blessing and a curse: I tend to get really excited to tackle a new problem or interest…only to drop that and move to the next. While I have grown to love/hate that part of my personality, it has, no doubt, given me a wide variety of skills that help in almost all work I do.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><img src="/images/icon.png" alt="Alt text" />
<strong>Illustration &amp; Writing</strong>
<em>I grew up as an avid illustrator and writer, and from an early age, created my own books and comics to sell to classmates. Some of my early influences were Dragon Ball Z, Goosebumps, Mortal Kombat, and Pokemon. I still try to include illustrations and storytelling into all work I do.</em></p>
  </li>

<strong>Animation</strong>
<em>I went to college for traditional animation. While I enjoyed apects of what I was doing, such as creative writing and storyboarding, I disliked the repetitiveness and time-consuming nature of actually producing animations. In recent years, however, I have been dusting off my animation skills and working with After Effects.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img src="/images/icon.png" alt="Alt text" />
<strong>Graphic Design</strong>
<em>I switched majors to graphic design my junior year of college after falling in love with Photoshop. I focused on corporate identity, such as logos and packaging, as well as publication design. As I’ve progressed as a designer, my attention has moved past traditional mediums, and more into digital, such as web and apps. I still enjoy designing the occasional logo or business card.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img src="/images/icon.png" alt="Alt text" />
<strong>Web Design/Development</strong>
<em>After graduation, I moved from Pittsburgh to Chicago, on my own, to look for job opportunities. After getting involved in the local tech start-up scene, I began my career as a self-taught web designer/developer. I focus mainly building the front-end on websites— specifically the UI/UX, and bringing it to life with HTML, CSS, and JS.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img src="/images/icon.png" alt="Alt text" />
<strong>Creative Direction</strong>
<em>I have been involved in many large-scale projects early in my career that would require me to take on many aspects of the product design process: instead of crafting just a logo or interface, I would be responsible for crafting entire brands and entire web/app products. I very much enjoy creating and mangaing a vision/voice for product.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img src="/images/icon.png" alt="Alt text" />
<strong>Product Design</strong>
<em>You can’t work on other people’s ideas all day without having a few of your own— I’ve been taking my assortment of skills and applying them to side-projects that focus on solving problems I’m passionate about. It’s a whole other animal bridging the gap between the customer-facing and business side of a product. I’m learning how to improve customer conversion, A/B test, and monetize on the go.</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>
