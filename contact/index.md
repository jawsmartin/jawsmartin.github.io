###Work Inquiries

While I'm not currently looking for new full-time work, I'm always open to interesting opportunities to work with great people. If you think you have something we can work on together, such as consulations, speaking engagements, or offsite, short-term contract work, don't hesitate to [shoot me an email](mailto:hellojoshmartin@gmail.com).

Please note that I receive many, many emails, so it may take me a while to get back to you. Expect a response within 1-2 weeks. Also, **please do not contact me via Linkedin as I rarely use the platform.**

###Connect

Aren't necessarily looking to work together, but want to connect? I extend the offer of coffee, scones, and some amazing small (or big) talk in **downtown Chicago**. An email is always appropriate, but a simple [tweet](http://www.twitter.com/jawsmartin) works really well.
