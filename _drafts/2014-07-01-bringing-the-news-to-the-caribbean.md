It's not every day you get to design a product for entire countries like Jamaica and Haiti, so when Aggrego was brought in to design the digital news network, "Loop", in Spring 2014, I was definitely excited. Digicel, a communications company that handles phones in the Carribean, wanted to capitalize on their significant involment in their customers' lives by creating the ultimate source.

###We Brought in Our Own Guy

We ended up working with with Digicel on the Loop project for about 6 months and was equal parts exciting and frustrating. We were contracted with the task to build this ultimate Caribbean news apps front to back.

For the Loop project, we were going to be compensated with a large $15mil investment wich would have also included our involvment in the Today Ireland project as well. However, with both Digicel and Aggrego not coming together on a product thet were happy with, they ultimately back out on all accounts. We ended up getting half of the investment and Aggrego's involvement with Today Ireland was short-lived and eventually cancelled.

Not all was lost however, as Michael Ferro, a previous Aggrego Investor, came in last minute and convinced Digicel to stay onboard with Aggrego, investing another $10million into Aggrego, moving us to start the Sun-Times Network, a nationwide expansion of his 2009 purchase, the Chicago Sun-Times.
