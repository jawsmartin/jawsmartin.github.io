title: Reflecting On My Undergrad
deck: It's amazing seeing the progress I made as an artist from my freshman year in 2008, to the the time graduated in 2012. All around, I learned everything I would ever need to in order to be successful.

I went to college at Edinboro University, a liberal arts college in northwestern Pennsylania that is highly regarded for its teaching and arts programs.

I admittedly half-assed my way there. Unlike most (seemingly), I was quite unsure what I was going to do after High School. I  *knew* I had to go college, but where and for what was couldn't have been further from my mind. I knew I liked art and writing; I've been drawing and writing stories since I knew how to hold a pencil (Reading and collecting Goosebumps books as a kid, then trying to create my own, was probably where it all started)

But, as the adage goes, you can't make money as an artist (or writer) and as such, never took my those interests as anymore than a hobby. I figured that the most sensible thing would be to buckle down and pick something straight-laced and dependable, such as teaching or business.

So, my senior year of High School, I took every generic business class I could find: accounting, marketing, public speaking, business essentials and applied for whatever colleges my friends were going to. (At the time, the big 3 choices were Clarion University, St. Vincent University, and IUP)

Things were seemingly on the right path until, like most stories worth telling, I met a girl. This particular girl was every bit as artsy as me (but way, way more talented) and she was totally going to pursue it seriously. It was a pretty significant in that it motivated me to do the same. Why be a vanilla, white bread businessman when I can draw/write for a living? Hell, maybe I won't make much, but who knows.

So, long story short, I ditched the "safe and sensible" plan and hopped on "let's follow this girl to the frozen tundra of northwestern PA and do artsy stuff" train.

It all worked out, fortunately, but it's pretty ridiculous how nonchalant I was about making such a huge pivot. I'm pretty sure I put in my application to Edinboro only a few months before graduating without even knowing anything other than it's a "great art school" and said girl would be there. 

So ridiculous.

Anyways, At Edinboro, I came in thinking my love of drawing and writing would translate very well to traditional animation. The program involved not only a base of essential foundation classes to make me a better, faster drawer, but it put me for the first time, in an environment surrounded by those just like me. We all liked drawing and storytelling.

While I enjoyed aspects of the program, traditional animation, as a whole wasn't for me. Storyboard was great, creating characters was great, but sitting in a basement on a lighttable for 8hrs at a time wasn't. I absolutelhy *dreaded* the process of frame-by-frame drawing, then uploading them to a computer one-by-one, then trying to sync audio. It was hell. I remember thinking "I'm not supposed to hate my major. Soemthing is wrong here."

At the time this was going down, I was playing with Adobe Photoshop CS2. I had no idea how to use it. MY only prior experience was Microsoft Paint. This meant I only knew how to use the paintbrush tool (I eventually learned the eyedropper and zoom tool).

I was hooked

I'd spend *hours* just staring at this computer screen coloring in my drawings. I'd zoom in to 1600% to try to make straight clean curves/lines.

Hilariously, I didn't know the difference between a .JPG and a .PSD file, so I naturally used .JPG when saving and when I reopened the file and zoomed in again, all my neat lines I took forever to make, were pixelated. I also didn't know what Layers were. This was all one giant flat image.

Like a guy checking out a girl at a bar while already in a relationship, I took a graphic design class on the side just to see if it got any better.

And it did.

I took a "Intro to Graphic Design" course with a very amazing teacher, Brigett Davitt, who sparked what would eventually


A few of my favorite projects from my undergrad.

###On to bigger and better things

The excitement for MyTown variations of the Pioneer Press was short-lived however.
After launching the newly redesigned Pioneer Press Site, we stepped away from it, momentarilary, to focus on building Loop and Today.ie, but revisited it a few months later. When we started back up with Pioneer Press, the objective was to add dedicated iOS and Android Apps.
