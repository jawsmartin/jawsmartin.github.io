    <span class="select">Background</span>
    <p>I went to <a href="http://www.edinboro.edu" class="link">school</a> for animation, traditional print design, and creative writing which has greatly influenced the style of work I do today.</p>
    <p>At the moment, I am most passionate about <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1964930-Narro?list=users&offset=24" class="link">web/app UI/UX</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2045614-Shotgun?list=users&offset=1" class="link">Illustration</a>. I think the two fulfill my needs to be creative and express myself, as well as to tinker and solve problems.</p>
    <p> With that being said, my interests don't start and end in those two areas. I love having my hands in a little bit of everything. I tend to pick up skills here-and-there for projects which has lead to learning branding, web development, typography, and copywriting.</p>   
    <span class="select">What I Do</span>   
    <p>My experience, thus far, as been in working in local e-commerce, data visualization, and large-scale digital news media. I have helped shape products all across the United States, as well as in the <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1538687-Loop-Alt?list=users&offset=29" class="link">Caribbean</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1540441-Ellipse-Mobile" class="link">Ireland</a>.</p>
    <p>I identify most as a problem-solver. I aim to create clear, efficient, and most importantly, objective, solutions to product-oriented problems. I make sure said solutions are cohesive with branding and voice, as well as within development capabilities and any imposed limitations or constraints. I also feel comfortable in taking charge of projects and leading/teaching others.</p>  
    <p>Outside of client responsibilities, I manage a great deal of personal projects, such as <a href="#" class="link">Squawk</a>, a movie review platform, and <a href="#" class="link">UXFairy</a>, a resource UI/UX library.</p>

    <span class="select">My Work</span>
    <p>I frequently post snapshots of my latest WIP's on <a href="http://www.dribbble.com/jawsmartin" class="link">Dribbble</a> and detailed project write-ups on <a href="http://www.behance.net/hellojoshmartin" class="link">Behance</a>.</p>
    <p>Below are a few projects that most accurately represent the type, style, and scope of work I do.</p>
