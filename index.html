        <p>I tend to work primarily with development teams, creating wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, prototypes, UI kits, and brand assets/style guides for web and mobile products. When needed, I also assist in front-end development: HTML5, CSS3/SASS, and Javascript.</p>

        <p>I would describe my design style as functionality-over-aesthetic, boring, and developer-friendly. I love refactored stylesheets, rigid brand guidelines, an up-to-date pattern library.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>I completed my B.F.A in 'Applied Media', with a concentration in corporate branding and identity, at the Edinboro University of Pennsylvania. I am a self-taught web developer and designer.</p>

        <p>In addition to various contract work, I've worked as a Front-End Developer for <a href="http://www.twitter.com/power2switch" class="link">@power2switch</a>, Lead UI/UX Engineer for <a href="http://www.twitter.com/suntimes" class="link">@suntimes</a>, and as Creative Director for <a href="http://www.twitter.com/threadmeup" class="link">@threadmeup</a>.</p>

        <p>Currently, I am an independent designer building with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/werewolf3d" class="link">@Werewolf3d</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/soapboxathletes" class="link">@Soapbox</a>, among others. <a href="mailto:jawsmartin@gmail.com" class="link">I may be available for your project, too.</a></p>

        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy Pittsburgh sports, playing basketball, and painting. I also manage a variety of <a href="/nononsense" class="link">side projects</a>.</p>
