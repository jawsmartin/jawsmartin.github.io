        <p>After completing a Bachelor of Applied Media Arts at the Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, I worked as a Front-End Developer for <a href="http://www.twitter.com/power2switch" class="link">@power2switch</a>, Lead UI/UX Engineer for <a href="http://www.twitter.com/suntimes" class="link">@suntimes</a>, and as Creative Director for <a href="http://www.twitter.com/threadmeup" class="link">@threadmeup</a>. <br><br>Currently, I am an independent designer building with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/werewolf3d" class="link">@werewolf3d</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/soapboxathletes" class="link">@Soapbox</a>, among others. <a href="mailto:jawsmartin@gmail.com" class="link">I may be available for your project, too.</a></p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I tend to work primarily with development teams, creating wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, prototypes, UI kits, and brand assets/styleguides for web and mobile products. When needed, I also assist in front-end development: HTML5, CSS3/SASS, and Javascript.</p>

        <p>I would describe my design style as functionality-over-aesthetic, boring, and developer-friendly. I love dry code, rigid brand guidelines, a well-kept framework.</p>

        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy Pittsburgh sports, playing basketball, and painting. I also manage a variety of <a href="/nononsense" class="link">side projects</a>.</p>
