	  	<p>I’m part of a small and hard-working team that has nearly refreshed the entirety of Carbonmade’s longstanding user experience – ranging from an overhaul of the core portfolio product, a series of complimentary applications (Messages, Network, etc.), and the look and feel of the illustration-heavy branding. We’ve created an extensible UI framework for future growth. I’m responsible for providing the core of the application’s user interface design as well as accompanying illustrations that span from in-app iconography, on-boarding experiences, email correspondence, to marketing campaigns.</p>
