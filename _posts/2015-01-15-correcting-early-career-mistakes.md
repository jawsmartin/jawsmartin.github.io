It's a little cathartic to reflect on your career with a sense of entitlement. You take credit when things went well, chalking it up to your grandeous contributions and you denounce all that went poorly to circumstances that were out of your hands. It is a very unhealthy perspective that I, admittedly, struggle with. While not easy in the slightest, I've been making a concerted effort to correct it.

<em>Please, in no way consider this a to-do list, or advice. This is not Medium and I have no intention of telling anyone how to go about their personal or professional career. The following are areas of I feel a need to improve on as I see them as only limiting how effective or successful I can be. As with every post, I share only because it provides insight.</em>


###Taking Criticism
I think it very fair to say we designers are a sensitive bunch. We are in a very unique position unlike many professionals in that our job is an extension of who we are. In that, when we aren't working, we are working. We tend to put so much thought and effort into our work that anything that hurts it is catostropic. Designer will spend hours, days, and weeks on a project only to hear 10min of feedback that goes against everything they did.

As I started to learn how much more there is to web design, I felt dumber and dumber...so ridiculously useless. I didn't know Javascript. I didn't know PHP. I had no clue what CMS stood for. I was scared shitless of the Terminal in fear I'd brick my laptop. I didn't know what or how to access mySQl

I will turn off.

###Patience
I'm a go, go, go type person when it comes to my work. I take it very seriously and try to be fast and efficient. However, especially in a corporate enviornment, where I have the most experience, you can runinto more than a few speedbumps.

Even a few of my clients have said "You have an extremely informal way of talking. It doesn't necessarily come across as creating confidence. It's not until you start talking about design do we understand we are in good hands." 

I believe the way you dress also is extremely important. As I started to learn how much more there is to web design, I felt dumber and dumber...so ridiculously useless. I didn't know Javascript.

###Confidence, Valuing Your Time
I have never been particularly comfortable putting a price on my work or the energy I put into it. But, as a creative professional, its an absolute must.
