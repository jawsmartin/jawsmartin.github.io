I know, for a fact, I'm addicted to Dribbble &mdash; I check it before every project for inspiration and several times a day just to see what what is trending. For all intents and purposes, I do not need any other reminder of what is happening there. However, my friend and co-worker, [Josh Beckman](http://www.andjosh.com), does.

I sent that ungrateful bastard one of my Dribbble invites over a year ago an he has only posted [one shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/1426532-Soundcloud-Logo-Animation?list=searches&amp;offset=0). His excuse(s)? "I just don't have time to get on there... I forget it exists... It's awful to look at on my small phone..." 
   
To thrust Mr. Beckman back into the game, we worked together to make [Alleyooop](http://www.alleyooop.info), a customizable newletter of Dribbble shots. You can adjust frequency of the newsletter and the type of shots you want to follow.

{% include image.html name="thumbnail" caption="Looks great on your phone" %}

Currently, we only show the most popular shots (views + likes) from either Animated or nonanimated shots, but hope to allow even more filtration, such as location and by tag, but are currently limited by Dribbble's API.

I think the newsletter can be quite handy for not only Beckman, but other people too good or too busy (or too smart) to visit Dribbble regularly.

[Give it a try!](http://www.alleyooop.info)
