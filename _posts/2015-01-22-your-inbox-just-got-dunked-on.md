I know, for a fact, I'm addicted to Dribbble &mdash; I check it before every project for inspiration and several times a day just to see what what is trending. For all intents and purposes, I do not need any other reminder of what is happening there. However, my friend and co-worker, [Josh Beckman](http://www.andjosh.com), does.

I sent that ungrateful bastard one of my Dribbble invites over a year ago an he has only posted [one shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/1426532-Soundcloud-Logo-Animation?list=searches&amp;offset=0). His excuse(s)? "I just don't have time to get on there... I forget it exists... It's awful to look at on my small phone..." 
    
To thrust Mr. Beckman back into the game, we came up with [Alleyooop](http://www.alleyooop.info): a customizable newletter of Dribbble shots. You can adjust frequency of the newsletter and the type of shots you want to follow. Currently, we only show the most popular shots (views + likes) from either Animated or nonanimated shots, but hope to allow even more filtration, such as location and by tag (the Dribbble API isn't our favorite thing right now).

I think the newsletter can be quite handy for not only Beckman, but other people too good or too busy (or too smart) to visit Dribbble regularly. [Give it a try!](http://www.alleyooop.info)
