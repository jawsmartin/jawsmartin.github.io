title: My First Real Job
deck: The project began with ambitious goals to completely revamp the 30-website network, but was, unfortunately, crippled by the fear of straying too far from the path.

excerpt: Prior to getting a job at Power2Switch, I had only ever worked for minimum wage, which, between 2006-2012, sat firmly between $6.25-$7.25. I never got a raise, asked for raise, or expected a raise. I just clocked in, worked my 40hrs, hoped for overttime, and clocked out. So, when I sheepishly asked for $15/hr for my first web design and development job...and got it, I was a little more than estatic.

*NOTE: This post is dated Apr 2013, but was written in Mar 2015. I wish I had wrote about this part of my life as it actually happened, but I didn't think to. This blog, while sometimes spur of the moment, is more or less, an honest timeline of my life personally and professionally. When I finally decided to taking writing seriously, I wanted to make sure it was thorough and not just hacked together. With that in mind, I've been going back and highlighting important moments, like this one, to build a more complete narrative.* 

One of the first major projects I worked on at Aggrego was the redesign of the Pioneer Press, which is a collection of local newspapers and websites covering the Chicago suburbs. It is owned by the Sun-Times Media Group (which is owned by Wrapports) and operated by Aggrego.

For the redesign, we needed to create a new homepage and article template that could be duplicated across all 30+ websites of the Pioneer Press. Generally speaking, the goals of the redesign were building a responsive layout and changing content management systems.

The previous Pioneer Press site was not mobile-friendly, and content was uploaded to the site via an broken, hard-to-use, custom CMS. Our solutions to these problems were the <em>Pure CSS</em> grid framework and moving the entire network over to <em>Wordpress</em>.

With the core, system changes in place, the next obstacle was design the visuals. Our various departments: content, sales, management, developers, sat together and laid out their ideas for a better platform. It was my job to take their various input and get the ball moving.

• Responsive Layout
• Modern aesthetic
• Easy content management
• More advertising slots
• Better native content treatment
• Interal linking in article

###Stepping Up

When I was brought into Aggrego, it was initially as a UI Designer. I was going to be working alongside another UI designer and front-end developer, Bruce Aukerman. Together, we were going to work on all Aggrego web/mobile projects. However, after Bruce quit a few weeks after, I was left as the single designer.

This was extremely new to me. Previously, my only other experience in web design was working with Creative Leads, or doing my own, relatively novice, indpendent work. The proposition of leading a project only weeks into a job was a little nerve-wrecking, but mostly exciting.

So, when I began leading the redesign project, I definitely went 110%. I stayed up all night building wireframes and a comprehensive site-map, and a PDF presentation.

However, the result of my work turned out to be a learning experience. When I presented these high-level propositions, I could see the room falling asleep and eyes glossing over.

###The MyTown Project Cometh and Goeth

After launching the newly redesigned Pioneer Press Site, we stepped away from it, momentarilary, to focus on building Loop and Today.ie, but revisited it a few months later. When we started back up with Pioneer Press, the objective was to add dedicated iOS and Android Apps.

The question that was asked was "Why can't we do this formula in other suburbs around major cities?" The inspiration came at the combination of Trib Local and Patch

###On to bigger and better things

The excitement for MyTown variations of the Pioneer Press was short-lived however.
