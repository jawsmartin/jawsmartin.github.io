Dribbble is my choice of social media for sharing my work. I love that it focuses on spontaneity and WIP, not necessarily polished, completed projects (see [Behance](http://blog.dribbble.com/2012/04/27/pro2.html)). With that being said, the platform is built for just that&mdash;quick uploads, small thumbnails, simple portfolios, etc.

However, as time has passed, I use the platform less and less for sharing my own work and more for following professionals in my field that inspire me and collecting their work for future reference.

Currently, the only way to manage this list of followers and their work on Dribbble is by combing through your giant pools of 'Likes' and 'Following'. 

As someone who has used the platform for a few years, those pools are several hundred items full. To recall an artist or their work that I found a week ago can take 10+ minutes if I even find them at all.

The only other route is a blind search of the entire website, hoping to the artist tagged their work appropriately and that the work got enough likes + views to be somewhere near the top.

Obviously, neither of these are very effective.

A solution I came up for this was creating an expansive list bookmarks in my browser, filled with links to artist Dribbble pages, and organized by skills and location. 

This has worked for me and solved my biggest issue with Dribbble until Josh Beckman, suggested creating a similar functioning website that provided a tailored experience.

The tool we came up with was Bbbbench. It would be a bookmarking website in which you could take artists you follow and divide them up into unqiue groups for quick referencing. 

{% include image.html name="homepage-2" caption="Bbbench Homepage" %}

{% include image.html name="view" caption="Drag and Drop Interface for creating benches" %}

{% include image.html name="view-bench" caption="You can view a bench by members or their artwork" %}

We worked on Bbbench, off-and-on, for about 2 months. I would draw up the interfaces and UX, and Beckman would develop it. With the intention that the product could be very useful, I spent some extra time working on its branding, making a variety of illustrations and iconography.

###So 3008, So 2000 and late

Late one night towards the end of the project, maybe a few days before pushing it live, I received a notification on Dribbble that said "User has added you to list." I wasn't quite sure what that meant, and low-and-behold, Dribbble implemented an organization feature that functioned exactly like Bbbench. 

Actually, they implemented it in [April 2012](http://blog.dribbble.com/2012/04/27/pro2.html), a whole *two years* before we so brilliantly came up with the idea.

{% include image.html name="add" caption="You can add members to a list through a dropdown" %}

{% include image.html name="lists" caption="You can view all of your created list in a separate section" %}

While I most certainly think the feature was implemented poorly, that fact is that that the entire functionality of Bbbench already existed on the platform.

Bbbench became pretty much useless and we stopped working on it immediately.

###Going Forward

I have discussed with Beckman the possible pivot from web app to brower widget that could still make the quick referencing functionality of Bbbench still viable, but we have yet to take action on it.

The project was fun nonetheless and a good exercise in creating a product from the ground up. It also gives perspective on the cutthroat startup culture where your next "big idea" is probably already being made by a dozen other people.
