  <p class="lead-paragraph"><em>I know, for a fact, I'm addicted to Dribbble</em>&mdash; I check it before every project for inspiration and several times a day just to see what what is trending. For all intents and purposes, I do not need any other reminder of what is happening there. However, my friend and co-worker, <a href="http://www.andjosh.com" class="link pink">Josh Beckman</a>, does.</p>

  <p>I sent that ungrateful bastard one of my Dribbble invites over a year ago an he has only posted <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1426532-Soundcloud-Logo-Animation?list=searches&offset=0" class="link pink">one shot</a>. His excuse(s)? "I just don't have time to get on there... I forget it exists... It's awful to look at on my small phone..."</p>      

  <p>To thrust Mr. Beckman back into the game, we came up with <a href="http://www.alleyooop.info" class="link pink">Alleyooop</a>: a customizable newletter of Dribbble shots. You can adjust frequency of the newsletter and the type of shots you want to follow. Currently, we only show the most popular shots (views + likes) from either Animated or nonanimated shots, but hope to allow even more filtration, such as location and by tag.</p>

  <p>I think the newsletter can be quite handy for not only Beckman, but other people too good or too busy (or too smart) to visit Dribbble regularly. <a href="http://www.alleyooop.info" class="link pink">Give it a try!</a></p>
