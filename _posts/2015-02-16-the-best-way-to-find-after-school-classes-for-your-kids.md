*In the summer of 2014, I was approached by my former [Aggrego] co-worker, [Sal Abassi]*, to help get a personal project off the ground; that project would be Afterskoolz. As a parent, he felt there was an opportunity to create a platform to make finding and planning after-school activiites for his children easier.

Sal, alongside fellow parent and Afterskoolz co-founder, [Mustafa Patni], laid out a rough draft of all the features they wanted Afterskoolz to have, such as simple search functionality, class registration, teacher-to-parent messaging, and a schedule-overlayed calendar. With their vision laid out, it was my job to bring it to life.

###Planning/Research

Sal and Mustafa staked out their competition well before bringing me onboard and discovered the space for innovation is huge: Not a single business for finding after-school activities showed up in Google Search &mdash; Only definitions for after-school activity, reasons why aftershool activities are fun, and a few government-run organizations.

It was concluded that the closest competition in after-school class discovery was a San Francisco-based startup, called [Kidfully]; it focused on the social aspect of reviewing and sharing after-school activities with fellow parents, a direction similar, but not the same as Afterskoolz.

Afterskoolz would be less about recommendations and building a social community (i.e Kidfully, [Yelp],[Angie's List]), and more about shopping and registering&mdash; making it more similar to traditional shopping sites, such as [Amazon] or even [Grubhub].

<!-- User-Studies
================================================== -->

###User-Studies

Afterskoolz was built with four types of users: Parents, Teachers, Principals, and Adminsitrators &mdash; all with very unique set of needs

The needs of the users determined what functionality the product needed. Many new features were added, while some earlier proposed ideas were reinforced, and other axed.

<!-- Homepage

###Homepage

The homepage, like in most projects, tends to draw the most input from clients; they usually have a pretty clear vision for how they want to present their product and the atmosphere they want to create for prospective visitors.

Because of this, the back-and-forth between myself and the client tends to take far longer than any other aspect of the website's UI. In designing the Afterskoolz homepage, the main areas of concern from the client was picking a powerful (yet friendly) hero image, a very direct search CTA, and a fun way to list the available classes.

Outside of solving for the client's main concerns, I wanted to make sure the homepage got the Afterskoolz branding across in a tasteful, subtle manner. It's pretty standard in modern design practices for homepages to be: Hero image, CTA, and product selling points.

I followed this formula pretty closely and added illustrations to compliment the various sections. By going relatively simple, the homepage responded down to tablet and mobile very nicely.

###Future

Over the course of a project, you inherently become better and smarter; you know find your mistakes in the first month and so on. However, it is impossible to move forward if you keep looking back. One of the hardest things you can do is say: "Hey, this isn't perfect. There's a lot of things I'd like to change now that I know better, but we'll cross that bridge later." The main thing is delivering a solid product so it can be developed and launched. That's why it's called an MVP.
