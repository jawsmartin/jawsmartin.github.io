title: Redesigning the Pioneer Press
deck: The project began with ambitious goals to completely revamp the 30-website network, but was, unfortunately, crippled by the fear of straying too far from the path.

###Background

One of the first major projects I worked on at Aggrego was the redesign of the Pioneer Press. The Pioneer Press is a collection of local newspapers and websites covering the Chicago suburbs. It is owned by the Sun-Times Media Group (which is owned by Wrapports).

The goal of the redesign wasn't simply an aesthetic improvement, but a revamp to the entire product. Feedback to the current product was lukewarm at best. It was widely accepted that is was passable, but the team wanted to refresh the platform to better monetize it.

The points of emphasis in the redesign were monetization, namely creating more advertising and native content.

In addition

It's not every day you get to design a product for entire countries like Jamaica and Haiti, so when Aggrego was brought in to design the digital news network, "Loop", in Spring 2014, I was definitely excited. Digicel, a communications company that handles phones in the Carribean, wanted to capitalize on their significant involment in their customers' lives by creating the ultimate source.

###Stepping Up

When I was brought into Aggrego, it was initially as a UI Designer. I was going to be working alongside another UI designer and front-end developer, Bruce Aukerman. Together, we were going to work on all Aggrego web/mobile projects. However, after Bruce quit a few weeks after, I was left as the single designer.

This was extremely new to me. Previously, my only other experience in web design was working with Creative Leads, or doing my own, relatively novice, indpendent work. The proposition of leading a project only weeks into a job was a little nerve-wrecking, but mostly exciting.

With that being said, my contributions to Sun-Times Network began and ended with the direction given to me by this group. As the lead designer of this project, I did my best to propose solutions and ideas, but ultimately, it was my job to carry out their vision.

Afterskoolz would be less about recommendations and building a social community like sites such as Kidfully or Angie's List, and more about shopping and registering&mdash; making it more similar to traditional shopping sites, such as [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com) or even [Grubhub](http://www.grubhub.com). 

As a 24yr old, single, recent college grad, the platform obviously doesn't speak to me and my needs, but, it doesn't take much to understand how such a platform could revolutionize what appears to be a stagnant industry. 

Afterskoolz could, potentially, be the go-to destination for parents to browse a large selection of after-school activities in their city and easily, quickly get their children involved; it would completely rid the burden of tradtional paperwork and phone calls, making the process as simple as ever.

What's even more amazing, is the platform doesn't have to stop at after-school activities: it could completely replace traditional class registration at every educational level. Take this scenario for example: You just moved to a new city and need to register your child into the new local school. What do you do? You call the school, schedule an appointment, gather identification materials, and physically go to said school to fill out paperwork...why should anyone have to do that in 2015?

While the inital plan for Afterskoolz isn't quite ready to tackle a terriotry like complete school registration, it is an important aspect to keep in mind for the future, especially as I build my blueprint for the website. I must keep everything I design agile and capable of scaling and accomodating new features/functionaility.

###The MyTown Project Cometh and Goeth

After launching the newly redesigned Pioneer Press Site, we stepped away from it, momentarilary, to focus on building Loop and Today.ie, but revisited it a few months later. When we started back up with Pioneer Press, the objective was to add dedicated iOS and Android Apps.

The question that was asked was "Why can't we do this formula in other suburbs around major cities?" The inspiration came at the combination of Trib Local and Patch

###On to bigger and better things

The excitement for MyTown variations of the Pioneer Press was short-lived however.
