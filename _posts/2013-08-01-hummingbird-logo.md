Josh asked me to give a facelift to his brand's Hummingbird's logo, which is a standalone icon, He wanted clean and minimal. He wanted something in the style close to [Hummingbird](https://www.hummingbird.me): Thin contour lines and sharp details. It was important that the logo work at small and large scales, and black and white.

After some inital exploration, I put together something I was proud of. It took the length of Inglorious Basterds to do.
