Josh asked me to refresh Hummingbird's logo (which is a standalone icon, no type). He felt his current version had too jagged of contour lines, too many details and didn't work at a small scale.

For direction, Josh pointed me to Jord Riekwel's [Hummingbird](https://dribbble.com/shots/370581-Hummingbird), a logo he tried to purchase unsuccessfully prior to bringing me in.

I would characterize the desired icon as clean and minimal with sharp details; it is definitely strong enough to stand on its own, as well as be recognizable at any size.

While Josh asked for an icon very similar to Riekwel's, I wanted to make sure the direction I took was still unique, and most importantly different enough that the two marks could exist without stepping on each others' wings.

When I started exploring ideas for the logo, I knew from the start that I wanted it to be bold and strong. I experimented with lots of curves and sharp angles, cutting away at the overlapping sections where the tail and tail meet the body.

We ended up going with my second favorite direction (my first being a Japanese Rising Sun-inspired one) and it was probably the most straightforward merge of Jord's logo and Josh's: I took the general shape of Jord's and accentuated the wings and feathers with details similar to what Josh originally had. I also elongated and contorted it's body to suggest movement.

I put an emphasis to making the curves and angles exaggerated to give it the stronger look I was aiming for. I made its beak thick and hyperbolic for better legibility at smaller sizes.

Overall, I'm very happy with how the logo turned out. I knew when taking on the project that I was walking a fine line in terms of how similar Josh wanted the logo to be to Jord's, but I'm confident that we came up with a unique treatment.

Seeing the logo outside of a thumbnail also reinforces that it is its own identity, too. It has really taken on a personality all its own since I handed it off. I've seen it on t-shirts, wallpapers, cover photos, avatars...everywhere in all sorts of variations. It's pretty cool.
