Josh asked me to give a facelift to Hummingbird's logo, which is a standalone icon, often used ontop of dark photos and backgrounds. He felt his current version had too jagged of contour lines, too many details and didn't work at a small scale (it was also not a vector).

For direction, Josh pointed me to Jord Riekwel's [Hummingbird](https://dribbble.com/shots/370581-Hummingbird), a logo he tried to purchase unsuccessfully prior to bringing me in.

I would characterize the desired icon as clean and minimal with thin contour lines and sharp details. While it was requested to make an icon very similar to Riekwel's, I wanted to make sure the direction I took was still somewhat unique, and most importantly different enough that the two marks could exist together. Differences include more accentuated wings and feathers, a more elongated and contorted body, and a more pronounced beak.
