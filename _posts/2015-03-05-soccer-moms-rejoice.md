In the summer of 2014, I was approached by my former [Aggrego](http://www.aggrego.com) co-worker, [Sal Abassi](https://angel.co/sal-abbasi), to help get his personal project, Afterskoolz, off the ground. It would be a platform to make finding and planning after-school activites for children easier.

Sal, alongside fellow parent and Afterskoolz co-founder, [Mustafa Patni](https://angel.co/mustafa-patni), laid out a rough draft of all the features they wanted Afterskoolz to have, such as simple search functionality, class registration, teacher-to-parent messaging, and a schedule-overlayed calendar. With their vision laid out, it was my job to bring it to life through comprehensive UI/UX design and branding.

###Planning/Research

Sal and Mustafa explored their possible competition well before bringing me onboard, discovering the space for innovation was huge&mdash; Not a single platform for finding after-school activities will show up in a Google Search for "After-school activities for kids." You will only see listicles/articles on suggested activity ideas, a few local businesses, and unhelpful government-created programs.

Sal and Mustafa concluded that only competition in after-school class discovery was a small San Francisco-based startup, called [Kidfully](http://www.kidfully.com); Kidfully focuses on the social aspect of reviewing and sharing after-school activities with fellow parents in the SF area; this is a direction similar, but not the same for what was in mind for Afterskoolz.

{% include image.html name="mood-board" caption="Kidfully, Wyzant, Treehouse, and Amazon inspired Afterskoolz's design" %}

Afterskoolz would be less about recommendations and building a social community like sites such as Kidfully or Angie's List, and more about shopping and registering&mdash; making it more similar to traditional shopping sites, such as [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com) or even [Grubhub](http://www.grubhub.com). 

As a 24yr old, single, recent college grad, the platform obviously doesn't speak to me and my needs, but, it doesn't take much to understand how such a platform could revolutionize what appears to be a stagnant industry. 

Afterskoolz could, potentially, be the go-to destination for parents to browse a large selection of after-school activities in their city and easily, quickly get their children involved; it would completely rid the burden of tradtional paperwork and phone calls, making the process as simple as ever.

What's even more amazing, is the platform doesn't have to stop at after-school activities: it could completely replace traditional class registration at every educational level. Take this scenario for example: You just moved to a new city and need to register your child into the new local school. What do you do? You call the school, schedule an appointment, gather identification materials, and physically go to said school to fill out paperwork...why should anyone have to do that in 2015?

While the inital plan for Afterskoolz isn't quite ready to tackle a terriotry like complete school registration, it is an important aspect to keep in mind for the future, especially as I build my blueprint for the website. I must keep everything I design agile and capable of scaling and accomodating new features/functionaility.

###User-Studies

As I started to build the outline for Afterskools, it was very important, from a high-level, to understand exactly the type of users who would uses it.

**Administrators**

Adding Afterskoolz functionality for children, such as the ability to talk with their classmates and teachers for children was discussed, but shelved for future updates.

###Features and Functionality

Based on these user case-studies, I can figure out which features/functionalities are necessary to satisfy each user's needs. While the obvious goal is provide every feature these users would desire, it is imporant to discern what is essential and what isn't. You can always iterate on the product and add feature-after-feature, but you have to make it viable even at it's simplest; this is especially true in creating a product that can be shipped quickly.

###Site Map

It's easiest to understand the Afterskoolz platform by looking at it from a bird's eye view; it is extremely multifunctional: It acts as a public-facing discovery tool, a e-commerce platform, a private organization service, a communication interface, and a management aid. All of these functions differ in one way or another from user-to-user. It can get quite confusing if it is not planned and organized properly.

{% include image.html name="site-map-detailed-mobile" caption="A blueprint to show exactly how it is all connected" %}

### Wireframes

After determining how the site is organized and what pages are needed, I define the website's front-facing visuals. I establish layout, page content, user-interface elements. I also double-check the site's UX as I work page-to-page. It's pretty easy to change course or make significant revisions at this step.

The goal of wireframes isn't to focus on the final product, but to illustrate, at the most basic level, the functionality or purpose of each page. Elements such color and branding are, no doubt, an important part of any website, but they don't (or shouldn't, at least) affect how a page/website will work. In my experience, at least, adding these superfluous details only causes distraction.

###Prototyping

Prototyping has dramatically changed how I work with clients. In the past, clients and myself would exchange long, winded emails with static .JPEGs. They would look over my images, without context, and use their best judgement to guess how they would work in real life. Sure, a sitemap or wireframe can alleviate the guess-work a bit, but it not quite as intuitive as actually interacting with it.

{% include image.html name="prototype" caption="It's easy to spot UX flaws when using prototypes" %}

Besides being a better way for clients to test their potential product, prototyping is also invaulable for testing my designs on multiple devices. I, personally, use [Invison](http://www.invisionapp.com) which allows for testing on mobile and tablet, in addition to desktop. It's extremely helpful to make sure everthing I initially design on a laptop, does in fact, look how I want it on other devices.

###Branding and Logo

In addition to my involvement in the web design process, I also worked heaviliy in branding. Sal and Mustafa came to me with the "Afterskoolz" name and some general direction: they wanted it to be "fun and friendly," emphasize color, and, in no way, be confused with a corporate business.

I explored several ideas and eventually chose to base the branding off of a chalkboard motif as it pertains to classrooms and students. I liked the idea of scribbled headlines and doodle-style illustrations. I also felt that the dark blue of a chalkboard would work well with a very expansive color palette.

{% include image.html name="logo" caption="The logo was inspired by Toys R' Us, Google, Oreo, and ebay" %}

For the Afterskoolz logo, I chose a large, slab-serif typeface, [Chunkfive](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/chunkfive), that I felt was playful. I combined it with an another classroom motif, the teacher's apple. I felt a stylized version of it compliment the wordmark well and could still be strong on its own.

###Style Guide

With the branding in order, I translated it into a style guide for the website. I wanted to establish a consistent visual style for color, typography, illustrations, iconograpy, and UI elements.

{% include image.html name="style-guide" caption="A detailed style guide is very helpful when handing design off to developers" %}

###Homepage

The homepage, like in most projects, tends to draw the most input from clients; they usually have a pretty clear vision for how they want to present their product and the atmosphere they want to create for prospective visitors.

Because of this, the back-and-forth between myself and the client tends to take far longer than any other aspect of the website's UI. In designing the Afterskoolz homepage, the main areas of concern from Sal and Mustafa was picking a powerful (yet friendly) hero image, a very direct search CTA, and a fun way to list the available classes.

{% include image.html name="homepage" caption="The relatively-simple homepage design responds down nicely to tablet and mobile" %}  

Outside of solving for their main concerns, I wanted to make sure the homepage got the Afterskoolz branding across in a tasteful, subtle manner&mdash; personable, informal copywriting, delightful animations, spot illustrations, and playful iconography. 

As far as layout, it's pretty standard in modern design practices for homepages to be: Hero image, product selling points, website section highlights, and CTA. I followed this formula pretty closely.

###Search Results

The search-results page, in my opinion, is the most important page of the entire site; you want it to coney a large amount of information in a simple, unintimidating way. At the same time, you want to give users the ability to access a large varitey of additional details and search customization if needed.

{% include image.html name="search-results" caption="Sal and Mustafa stressed the importance of a map and save-class buttons in the page's design" %}   

---

###Class Profile

The class profile page is divided into 3 sections: details, endorsements, and schedule. The Details section elaborates on information showed initially in the search results, the Endorsements section showcases administrator-selected class recommendations (NOT Yelp-style reviews), and the schedule section presents all available sessions for enrollment.

{% include image.html name="class-profile" caption="The schedule section overlays a registered user's Google Calendar for easy referencing" %}

###Dashboard

As I've stated before, Afterskoolz isn't just about discovery and registration&mdash; it has a wide assortment of tools and functionality, each tailored for its three types of users (4 if you include administrators) For example, parents need the ability to manage their children's schedules, teachers need to send homework to students, principals need to manage rosters.

{% include image.html name="dashboard" caption="Users have all of their tools and information readily available in their dashboards" %}   

{% include image.html name="messaging" caption="Messaging is feature available to all users" %}

###Conclusion

Over the course of a project, you inherently become better and smarter; you tend to find your mistakes from the first month and the second month and so on. However, it is impossible to move forward if you keep looking back. One of the hardest things to do is say: "Hey, this isn't perfect. There's a lot of things I'd like to change now that I know better, but we'll cross that bridge later." The main thing is delivering a solid product so it can be developed and launched. That's why it's called an MVP.

That being said, after about four months of working on Afterskoolz, there is definitely areas I would like to revist and improve. Specifically, I'd like to improve main/sub navigation, redesign search results page, expand branding color palette, and add stronger illustrations.

{% include image.html name="search-results-future" caption="Messaging is feature available to all users" %}   
{% include image.html name="email-future" caption="Messaging is feature available to all users" %}  

While I have a lot of things I'd like to improve about Afterskoolz, I am, overall, very proud of the product I helped build; I believe it has bright future.

At the moment I am writing this case-study, my designs are being handed over to developers with the hope that an Afterskoolz MVP (limited to Chicago-only) will be launched Summer 2015. I have also been working with Sal and Mustafa on possible social networking features, dedicated mobile apps, and API-based widgets.
