I went to college at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, a liberal arts college in northwestern Pennsylania that is highly regarded for its teaching and arts programs.

I admittedly half-assed my way there. Unlike most, seemingly, I was quite unsure what I was going to do after High School. I  *knew* I had to go college, but where and for what was never apparent. I knew I liked art. I've been drawing since I knew how to hold a pencil. I've been the "artsy" kid in every class I ever had. 

But, as the adage goes, you can't make money as an artist. I treated it as a hobby for the most part think I had no future in it. My senior year of High School, I took every generic business class I could find: accounting, marketing, public speaking, business essentials... I figured 

A few of my favorite projects from my undergrad.

###On to bigger and better things

The excitement for MyTown variations of the Pioneer Press was short-lived however.
After launching the newly redesigned Pioneer Press Site, we stepped away from it, momentarilary, to focus on building Loop and Today.ie, but revisited it a few months later. When we started back up with Pioneer Press, the objective was to add dedicated iOS and Android Apps.
