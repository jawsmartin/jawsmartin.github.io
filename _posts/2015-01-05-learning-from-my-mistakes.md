*One of the aspects of design that has not only intrigued me, but has since become a personal professional mantra, is minmalism.* While on the surface, this idea of simplicity and liberation from clutter seems like a consensus objective, it's quite obvious the effort towards it is not very visible: everything in our culture is in excess. But, I don't think that it is from a lack of trying. Simplicity, in definition is uncomplicated, or uncompounded&mdash; lacking all that is not absolutely necessary. In such a state, one isn't left with much to protect themselves. You are at your most vulnerable.
