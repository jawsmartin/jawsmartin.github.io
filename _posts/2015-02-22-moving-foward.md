I have officially been coding for 2yrs, which in itself, is batshit crazy. I moved to Chicago after graduating college with a BFA in Applied Media Arts, which is just a fancy catch-all title for a blend of animation, traditional art, art history, and graphic design. I left with the toolset need to be an intern at a tiny, no-name studio in the cold, deserted land of Northwestern Pennsylvania. 

To make this happen, I contacted the charismatic, talented designer, Josh Fabian, a fellow Pennsylvanian who had recently made the move out west to Chicago. I asked him what would most-likely be defined as my "biggest risk I ever took": "Can you help me land a job in Chicago?" He graciously said yes. Not even a few hours after I drove over the Chicago Skyway for the first time did Josh, say: "Yeah. Nobody is hiring print designers, man. We need to get you learning how to make websites.

And that's how it all began. I didn't even know what 'span' was or even an 'inline-block'...I honestly knew nothing about web development. I was so intimidated by it. In college, I used one of those "code-free" website builders to build my first portfolio website. This particular flavor was Adobe Muse. 

But, after about two months of serious bootcamp-style development with help from Josh and some Treehouse courses, I was well on my way to my first job that would pay me above minimum wage.

While a seasoned developer can tell you that you can learn basic web development relatively quickly, it takes a long time to learn the idiosyncrasies of the entire package. In the two months of learning, I understood HTML, CSS, and the most buzzworthy word of 2013, responsive web design.

Over the next year, I would continue to refine my HTML and CSS skills, through the process of redesigning my portfolio and taking popular website like ESPN, and coding themselves. This is all well and good, but it was a little frustrating: everything I was doing was static. Just like the magazines I learned to design in college, my work is simply layouts, not everything needed to make a website.

As I started to learn how much more there is to web design, I felt dumber and dumber...so ridiculously useless. I didn't know Javascript. I didn't know PHP. I had no clue what CMS stood for. I was scared shitless of the Terminal in fear I'd brick my laptop. I didn't know what or how to access mySQl
