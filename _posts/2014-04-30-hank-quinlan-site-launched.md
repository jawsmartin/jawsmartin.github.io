description: "You will need one default image for jekyll to use in case the post does not have the thumbnail property. Just pick the one you like and put it somewhere in your web directory. For example, I put the image named nothumbnail.jpg in the images folder in the root directory of my site."
thumbnail: /images/hero-afterskoolz.jpg

Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
