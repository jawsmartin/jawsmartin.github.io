title: Unsolicited Behance Redesign
deck: Behance has by far one of the best CMS for artist portfolios on the web, but their platform is handicapped by not just dated design practices, but overall poor organization and layout; they are Linkedin's version of Dribbble.

In my relatively short time as a web designer, I have learned that Photoshop is, by far, the most common program for creating mockups and final deliverables. It's even built into the company vernactular: "Hey Josh, can you photoshop this for me." "Hey Josh, the developers need a .PSD of the final design", etc.

Well, this has always been a problem for me. As someone with an illustrator and traditional graphic design background, I work predominately in Adobe Illustrator. I not only feel extremely comofrtable with it, but I work the fastest with it.

What I don't understand is why more designers don't use it. From the one's I've talked to, most don't even know how to use it, having always worked in Photoshop. While Photoshop does, in fact, have vector shapes, everything in Illustrator is vectors. This is *extremely* useful when editing projects at various sizes and resolutions. 

Because I'm obviously in the minority as a Illustrator-using Web Designer, I have a very hard time finding high-quality, useful resources for mocking up web projects. Most of what is out there are brushes, patterns, iconography, etc. 

To remedy this, I make my own resources that I use to start every web-project. One of the most useful I've created is a set of grids. They are built around a 1200px layout. I have put together a variety of sizes as well as elements you can mix-and-match, to create layouts.

These grids are the backbone of every webproject I do. As a designer and developer, I know the importance of designing with development in mind. You can't just make something cause you think it looks good. You do not want to be *that guy* who hands a developer a mockup that will require an additional hour of back-and-forth trying to translate your design to a grid-layout.

If your are an Illustrator-using web designer, I really think you'll find this useful. As far as I know, there's nothing else out there that gives you a framework for your designs like this does.

- Desktop, Tablet, Mobile, and everything in between
- Drag and Drop columns and rows to build your own
- Percentage grids and fixed-pixel grids

Plus, it's only $10. *That's nothing*. I guarantee it will pay for itself after a single project.
