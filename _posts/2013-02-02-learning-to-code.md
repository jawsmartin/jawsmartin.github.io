title: Learning to Code
deck: The only experience I had in web design was a few months of Adobe Muse. Even then, I didn't dare look at the code. All I did was download the zip file and FTP it Bluehost.

excerpt: Like most traditional graphic designers, I had a real adverison to learning how to code. Even as I took my one-and-only web design class my junior year, I kept telling myself I would never need any of this because I'd be working in print.

*NOTE: This post is dated Feb 2013, but was written in Mar 2015. I wish I had wrote about this part of my life as it actually happened, but I didn't think to. This blog, while sometimes spur of the moment, is more or less, an honest timeline of my life personally and professionally. When I finally decided to taking writing seriously, I wanted to make sure it was thorough and not just hacked together. With that in mind, I've been going back and highlighting important moments, like this one, to build a more complete narrative.*
