title: Simplicity Takes Courage
deck: It can be comforting to surround yourself and your work with floruishes and excess to display to others your worth or value. It takes supreme confidence to show yourself off to the world with little to nothing to shield you from criticism.

*One of the aspects of design that has not only intrigued me, but has since become a personal professional mantra, is the idea of minimalism.* While on the surface, this idea of minimalism is simplicity and liberation from clutter seems like a consensus objective, it's quite obvious the effort towards it is not very visible: everything in our culture is in excess. But, I don't think that it is from a lack of trying.

Simplicity, in definition is uncomplicated, or uncompounded&mdash; lacking all that is not absolutely necessary. In such a state, one isn't left with much to protect themselves. You are at your most vulnerable.
