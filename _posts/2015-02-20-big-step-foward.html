      <p><em>I have officially been coding for 2yrs, which in itself, is batshit crazy</em>. I moved to Chicago after graduating college with a BFA in Applied Media Arts, which is just a fancy catch-all title for a crazy blend of animation, traditional art, art history, and graphic design. I left with the toolset need to be an intern at a tiny print shop in cold, deserted land of Northwestern Pennsylvania. In hopes that the bigger city would present opportunities for bigger jobs, I contacted the suave, charismatic, design juggernaut, Josh Fabian, a fellow Pennsylvanian who had recently made the move out west to Chicago.. Not even a week in did my friend, Josh Fabian, say: "Yeah. Nobody is hiring print designers, man. We need to get you learning how to make websites</p>

      <p>To thrust Mr. Beckman back into the game, we came up with <a href="http://www.alleyooop.info" class="link pink">Alleyooop</a>: a customizable newletter of Dribbble shots. You can adjust frequency of the newsletter and the type of shots you want to follow. Currently, we only show the most popular shots (views + likes) from either Animated or nonanimated shots, but hope to allow even more filtration, such as location and by tag.</p>

      <p>I think the newsletter can be quite handy for not only Beckman, but other people too good or too busy (or too smart) to visit Dribbble regularly. <a href="http://www.alleyooop.info" class="link pink">Give it a try!</a></p>
